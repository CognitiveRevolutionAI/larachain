This Order does not authorize violation of any federal, state, or local law or regulation.\n6 1. This Order does not authorize any act that results in the taking of a threatened or \nendangered species or any act that is now prohibited, or becomes prohi bited in the \nfuture, under either the California Endangered Species Act (Fish and Game Code \nsections 2050 to 2097) or the Federal Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C.A. sections \n1531 to 1544). If a  \"take\" will result from any action authorized under this Orde r, the \nMember shall obtain authorization for an incidental take prior to construction or operation \nof the project. The Member shall be responsible for meeting all requirements of the \napplicable Endangered Species Act.\n6 2. This Order does not supersede the  Central Valley Water Boards Basin Plans and \npolicies, or the State Water Boards plans and policies.\n6 3. As stated in California Water Code section 13263(g), the discharge of waste into waters \nof the state is a privilege, not a right, and regulatory cover age under this Order does not \ncreate a vested right to continue the discharge of waste. Failure to prevent conditions that \ncreate or threaten to create pollution or nuisance will be sufficient reason to modify, \nrevoke, or enforce this Order, as well as pro hibit further discharge.\n6 4. This Order requires Members to provide the  Third-Party  with contact information of the \nperson(s) authorized to provide access to the enrolled property for inspections. This \nrequirement provides a procedure to enable  Board staff  to  contact grower representatives \nso that it may more efficiently monitor compliance with the provisions of this Order.\n6 5. Any instance of noncompliance with this Order constitutes a violation of the California \nWater Code and its regulations. Such noncom pliance is grounds for enforcement action, \nand\/or termination of coverage for waste discharges under this Order, subjecting the \ndischarger to enforcement under the California Water Code for further discharges of \nwaste to surface or groundwater.\n6 6. All dis charges from the irrigated agricultural operation are expected to comply with the \nlawful requirements of municipalities, counties, drainage districts, and other local agencies \nregarding discharges to storm drain systems or to other courses under their juri sdiction.\n6 7. The fact that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the discharge in order to \nmaintain compliance with this Order shall not be a defense for violations of the Order by \nthe Member.\n6 8. This Order is not a National Pollutant Discharge  Elimination System Permit issued \npursuant to the Federal Clean Water Act. Coverage under this Order does not exempt a \nfacility from the Clean Water Act. Any facility required to obtain such a permit must notify \nthe Central Valley Water Board. "

Groundwater in the Tulare Lake Basi n Area has been designated for drinking \nwater uses; therefore, the water quality objective of 10 mg\/L for nitrate plus nitrite (as \nnitrogen) appl ies to groundwater in the Tulare Lake Basin Area. Where nitrate \ngroundwater quality data are not available, inf ormation on the hydrogeological \ncharacteristics of the area suggest that significant portions of the Tulare Lake Basin Area \nare vulnerable to nit rate contamination. Sources of nitrate in groundwater include \nleaching of excess fertilizer, confined animal fe eding operations, septic systems, \ndischarge to land of wastewater, food processor waste, unprotected well heads, \nimproperly abandoned wells, and  lack of backflow prevention on wells.\n20 . The Central Valley Water Boards authority to regulate waste discharg es that could \naffect the quality of the waters of the state, which includes both surface water and \ngroundwater, is found in the Porter -Cologne Wa ter Quality Control Act (California Water \nCode Division 7).\n21 . California Water Code section 13263 requires th e Central Valley Water Board to \nprescribe WDRs, or waive WDRs, for proposed, existing, or material changes in \ndischarges of waste that could affe ct water quality. The Board may prescribe waste \ndischarge requirements although no discharge report under Calif ornia Water Code \nsection 13260 has been filed. The WDRs must implement relevant water quality control \nplans and the California Water Code. The Ce ntral Valley Water Board may prescribe \ngeneral waste discharge requirements for a category of discharges if all  the following \ncriteria apply to the discharges in that category:\na) The discharges are produced by the same or similar operations;\nb)  The discharges i nvolve the same or similar types of waste;\nc)  The discharges require the same or similar treatment standards; and\nd)  The discharges are more appropriately regulated under general requirements than \nindividual requirements.\nThe rationale for developing general was te discharge requirements for irrigated \nagricultural lands in the Tulare Lake Basin Area includes: (a) discharg es are produced by \nsimilar operations (irrigated agriculture); (b) waste discharges under this Order involve  10\n \nSee, for example, the  California Department of Public Health Nitrate Fact  Sheet  <\nwww.cdph.ca.gov\/certlic\/drinkingwater\/Documents\/Nitrate\/FactSheet -Nitrate -05 -23 -2012.pdf > 11\n \nPEIR,  Appendix  A "

Applicable \nwater quality objectives include, but are not limited to, (1) the numeric objectives, including the \nbacteria objective, the chemical constituents objective (includes listed chemicals and state \ndr inking water s tandards, i.e., maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) promulgated in Title 22 \nCalifornia Code of Regulations (CCR) Division 4, Chapter 15 sections 64431 and 64444 that are \napplicable through the Basin Plan to waters designated as municipal and do mestic supply), \ndissolved oxygen objectives, pH objectives, the salinity objectives, and the turbidity objectives; \nand (2) the narrative objectives, including the biostimulatory substances objective, the chemical \nconstituents objective, and the toxicity ob jective. The Basin Plan also contains numeric water \nquality objectives that apply to specifically identified water bodies, such as specific temperature \nobjectives. Federal water quality criteria that apply to surface water are contained in federal \nregulations referred t o as the California Toxics Rule and the National Toxics Rule. See 40 CFR \nsections 131.36 and 131.38.\nWater quality objectives that apply to groundwater include, but are not limited to, (1) numeric \nobjectives, including the bacteria objective  and the chemical constituents objective (includes \nstate MCLs promulgated in Title 22 CCR Division 4, Chapter 15 section 64431 and 64444 and \nare applicable through the Basin Plan to municipal and domestic supply), and (2) narrative \nobjectives including the  chemical constituents, taste and odor, and toxicity objectives.\nThe requirements that waste discharge not unreasonably affect beneficial uses or cause a \ncondition of pollution or nuisance are prescribed pursuant to sections 13263 and 13241 of the \nCaliforni a Water Code.  Section 13263 of the California Water Code requires Regional Water \nBoards, when establishing waste discharge requirements, to consider the need to prevent \nnuisance and the provisions in section 13241 of the California Water Code. Section 1324 1 \nrequires Reg ional Water Boards to consider several factors when establishing water quality \nobjectives including prevention of nuisance and reasonable protection of beneficial uses.

Compliance with water \nquality objectives will protect the beneficial uses listed  in Findings  30 and  31.\n27 . The Tulare Lake Basin Plan identifies the greatest long -term problem facing the Basin as \nthe increase in salinity in groundwater. Because  of the closed nature of the Tulare Lake \nBasin, there is little subsurface outflow. Thus , salts accumulate within the Basin due to the \nimportation and evaporative use of water. A large portion of this increase is due to the \nintensive use of soil and water r esources by irrigated agriculture. The Tulare Lake Basin \nPlan recognizes that degradation  is unavoidable without a plan for removing salts from the \nBasin and that salt sources should be managed to the extent practicable to reduce the rate \nof groundwater de gradation until there is a long -term solution to the salt imbalance.\n28.

The  Salt and  Nitrate Control Program  establishes a framework for addressing \nlegacy an d ongoing salt and nitrate accumulation issues, with  the primary focus on early \nactions  (first ten years) on groundwater quality and in particular nitrate impacts to drinking \nwater su pplies. The amendments additionally establish a Surveillance and Monitori ng \nProgram to support the efforts of the control program and assess its  progress, and if \nappropriate, support efforts to re -evaluate the requirements of the control program .

R of  this Order and section V. H of the MRP.\n33 . In May 2004, the State Water Board adopted the  Policy for Implementation and \nEnforcement of the Nonpoint Source Pollution Control Program  (NPS Policy). The \npurpose of t he NPS Policy is to improve the state's abili ty to effectively manage NPS \npollution and conform to the requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act and the \nFederal Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990. The NPS Policy \nrequires, among other key  elements, an NPS control implementation prog rams ultimate \npurpose to be explicitly stated. It also requires implementation programs to, at a \nminimum, address NPS pollution in a manner that achieves and maintains water quality \nobjectives and beneficial us es, including any applicable antidegradation  requirements.\n34 . This Order constitutes an NPS Implementation Program for the discharges regulated by \nthe Order. The ultimate purpose of this program is expressly stated in the goals and \nobjectives for the ILRP , described in the PEIR and  Attachment A to this Order. \nAttachment A, Information Sheet, describes the five key elements required by the NPS \nPolicy and provides justification that the requirements of this Order meet the \nrequirements of the NPS Policy. This  Order is consistent with th e NPS Policy.\n35 . The United States Environmental Protection Agency adopted the National Toxics Rule \n(NTR) on 5 February 1993 and the California Toxics Rule (CTR) on 18 May 2000, which \nwas modified on 13 February 2001. The NTR a nd CTR contain water quality criteria which, \nwhen combined with beneficial use designations in the Basin Plans, constitute enforceable \nwater quality standards for priority toxic pollutants in California surface waters.\n36 . It is the policy of the State of  California that every human being has the right to safe, \nclean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and \nsanitary purposes. This order promotes that policy by, among other things, utilizing a \ntiered system that imposes  more stringent requirements  in areas deemed high \nvulnerability  based on threat to surface or groundwater quality, requiring surface and \ngroundwater monitoring and management plans, an identification and evaluation of \nmanagement practices that are protect ive of groundwater quality, and requiring \ndischarges to meet applicable water quality objectives, which include maximum \ncontaminant levels designed to protect human health and ensure that water is safe for \ndomestic uses. Protection of the beneficial uses o f surface and groundwater is described \nthroughout this Order, including the discussion in Attachment A to this Order of State \nWater Board Resolution 68 -16  Statement of Policy with Respect to Maintaining High \nQuality Waters in California .

Within the  Third-Party  area, there are approximately 981,000 acres of irrigated lands \nwithin Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) Groundwater Protection Areas \n(GWPAs). DPR identifies these ar eas as vulnerable to groundwater contamination from \nthe agricultural use of certain pesticides , based upon either pesticide detections in \ngroundwater or upon the presence of certain soil types (leaching and\/or runoff) and a \ndepth to groundwater shallower t han 70 feet. Of the 981,000 acres, approximately \n490,000 acres of the irrigated lands are with in DPR GWPAs that are characterized as \nvulnerable to leaching of pesticides (leaching areas), approximately 491,000 acres are \nwithin GWPAs that are characterized  as vulnerable to movement of pesticides to \ngroundwater by runoff from fields to areas where th ey may move to groundwater (runoff \nareas). For leaching areas, certain water soluble pesticides are carried mainly with \nexcess irrigation water or rainwater through the soil profile and potentially to the \nunderlying aquifer. For runoff areas, certain water  soluble pesticides are carried mainly \nwith runoff over the land surface to potential conduits to groundwater. However, DPR has \nnot established or analyzed the GW PAs with fertilizers and nitrate in mind, and its \nGWPAs are established based upon detections  of certain pesticides, many of which are \nof lower solubility. Solubility is one factor that can lead to groundwater contamination. \nDepending on the frequency of a pplication and amount applied, certain water soluble \nconstituents, such as nitrate, may share  common pathways to groundwater with soluble \npesticides. This Order includes consideration of DPRs vulnerability factors and GWPAs \nby the  Third-Party  in the deter mination of high vulnerability areas for nitrate.\n17 . The Central Valley Water Boards  Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program Existing \nConditions Report  (ECR) 8\nidentifies waters of the state with impaired water quality \nattributable to or influenced by irrigate d agriculture, including within the Third-Party  area. \nThe  Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program Environmental Impact Report  (PEIR) describes \nthat  [f]rom a pr ogrammatic standpoint, irrigated land waste discharges have the potential \nto cause degradation of sur face and groundwater\n18 . Approximately 11 water bodies encompassing 300 linear miles of surface water courses \nhave been listed as impaired pursuant to Cl ean Water Act section 303(d) 9\nwithin the \nThird -Party  area. Approximately 5 of those water bodies iden tify the potential source of \nthe impairment as agriculture, and the remaining water bodies identify an unknown \nsource impairment. For example, Elk Bayou a nd Kings River (Pine Flat to Island Weir) \nare listed as impaired by the pesticide chlorpyrifos. Agricu lture is identified as a potential \nsource of impairment.\n19 .

For  purposes of adoption of this Order, the Central Valley Water Board is the lead agency \npursuant to CEQA (Public Resources Code sections 21100 et seq.). Pursuant to  Board \ndirection in Resolutions R5 -2006 -0053 and R5 -2006 -0054, a  Program Environmental \nImpact  Report (PEIR) was prepared. In accordance with CEQA, the Central Valley Water \nBoard, acting as the lead agency adopted Resolution R5 -2011 -0017 on 7 April 2011, \ncertifying the PEIR for the Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program.\n3 8.The Central Valley Water Boa rd prepared a Supplemental Program Environmental \nImpact Report (SPEIR) to consider new project -level impacts from the Salt and Nitrate \nControl Program.  The SPEIR need not analyze all impacts from the Salt and Nitrate \nControl Pro gram, only those not previou sly analyzed in the Salt and Nitrate Control \nPrograms Substitute Environmental Document (SED) that was approved by the Central \nValley Water Board. (Pub. Res. Code section 22159.2, subd. (b).) The SPEIR found \nthat there were thr ee project-specific impacts  not fully considered in the SED: impacts to \nair quality, climate change, and transportation and circulation. The SPEIR therefore \nadded the Salt and Nitrate Control Program as a new alternative to the PEIR that could \nbe used in c onjunction to the other Alte rnatives and thoroughly identified, disclosed, and \nanalyzed impacts to those three categories. In accordance with CEQA, the Central \nValley Water Board, acting as the lead agency, adopted Resolution R5 -2021 -0017  on \n22 April 2021 , certifying the SPEIR.\n39 . This Order relies on the environmental impact analysis contained in the PEIR  and SPEIR \nto satisfy the requirements of CEQA. Although the Order is not identical to any of the \nPEIR alternatives, the Order is comprised entirely of e lements of the PEIRs wide range \nof alternatives. Therefore, the PEIR  and SPEIR identified, disclosed, and analyzed the \npotential environmental impacts of the Order. The potential compliance activities \nundertaken by the regulated Members in response to thi s Order fall within the range of \ncompliance activities identified and analyzed in the PEIR  and SPEIR . Therefore, all \npotentially adverse environmental impacts of this Order have been identified, disclosed, \nand analyzed in the PEIR  and SPEIR . If it is deter mined that a grower filing  for coverage \nunder this Order could create impacts not identified in the PEIR, individual WDRs would \nbe prepared for that grower and additional CEQA analysis performed, which would likely \ntier off the PEIR as necessary. (See Titl e 14, CCR section 15152).\n4 0. The requirements of this Order are based on elements of Alternatives 2 through 6 of the \nPEIR  and Alternative A . The PEIR concludes that implementation of some of these \nelements has the potential to cause significant adverse en vironmental impacts. Such \ni mpacts are associated, directly and indirectly, with specific compliance activities growers \nmay conduct in response to the Orders regulatory requirements. Such activities are \nexpected to include implementation of water quality m anagement practices and \nmon itoring well installation and operation. Attachment A of this Order describes example \nwater quality management practices that may be implemented as a result of this Order \nand that monitoring wells may be installed as a result of  this Order. The types and \nd egrees of implementation will be similar to those described in the PEIR for Alternatives 2 \nthrough 6.

It is intended that the fol lowing progressive enforcement steps will \ngenerally be taken in the event that the  Third-Party  fails to comply with the  terms and \nconditions of this Order or attached MRP:\na) First notification of noncompliance to the  Third-Party . The Central Valley Water \nBoard intends to notify the  Third-Party  of the non -compliance and allow a period of \ntime for the  Third-Party  to come back  into compliance. This notification may be in \nthe form  of a verbal notice, letter, or written notice of violation, depending on the \nseverity of the noncompliance.\nb)  Second notification of noncompliance to the  Third-Party .

California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR):  DPR has developed a \nGroundwater Protection Program under the authority o f the Pesticide Contamination \nPrevention Act (PCPA) (commencing with  Food and Agriculture Code section 13142). \nThe program is intended to prevent contamination of groundwater from the legal \napplication of pesticides. In addition to activities mandated by t he PCPA, DPRs program \nhas incorporated approaches to identify areas  vulnerable to pesticide movement, develop \nmitigation measures to prevent pesticide contamination, and monitor domestic drinking \nwater wells located in groundwater protection areas. The Gr oundwater Protection \nProgram can provide valuable information on pote ntial impacts to groundwater from \nagricultural pesticides. If necessary, DPR and the county agricultural commissioners can \nuse their regulatory authorities to address any identified impac ts to groundwater or \nsurface water attributable to pesticide discharg es from agricultural fields.\n5 4. California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA):  The CDFA Fertilizer Research \nand Education Program (FREP) coordinates research to advance the enviro nmentally \nsafe and agronomically sound use and handling of fertilizer  materials.  The University of \nCalifornia Agriculture and Natural Resources (UC ANR) and CDFA FREP developed and \nheld twelve  nitrogen management certification training  sessions  for Certifi ed Crop \nAdvisors (CCAs)  between 2012 and 20 20, certifying approximate ly 1,040  CCAs \nstatewide.  In 2021 CDFA partnered with UC ANR and the American Society of Agronomy \n(ASA) to create a specialty certification within the CCA program to replace the training \np rogram. The CCA California Nitrogen Management Specialty requires ext ra testing and \ncontinuing education requirements administered by ASA. CDFA has also developed a \nprogram to provide nitrogen management training to growers.  Among other certification \noptio ns available for Irrigation and Nitrogen Management Plans, the CDFA t raining \nprogram  and the CCA California Nitrogen Management Specialty  will be recognized as \nproviding the training necessary for a Member or CCA to certify Irrigation and Nitrogen \nManageme nt Plans. In addition, this Order requires the preparation of an Irri gation and \nNitrogen Management Plan and submittal of a summary report.

The surface water quality monitoring and trend groundwater quality monitoring under thi s \nOrder are regional and representative in nature and do not measure individual field \ndisc harge. The surface water quality monitoring will take place in surface water bodies \nthat are representative of surface waters receiving irrigated agricultural dischar ges. The \ntrend groundwater monitoring will take place in aquifers that are representative  of \naquifers receiving irrigated agricultural discharges. The benefits of regional monitoring \ninclude the ability to determine whether water bodies accepting discharge s from \nnumerous irrigated lands are meeting water quality objectives and to determine whet her \npractices, at the watershed level, are protective of water quality. There is a cost savings \nwith representative monitoring, since all surface waters or all ground water aquifers that \nreceive irrigated agricultural discharges do not need to be monitored.  Surface water and \ngroundwater monitoring sites are selected to represent areas with similar conditions (e.g., \ncrops grown, soil type). However, there are limitations  to regional monitorings \neffectiveness in determining possible sources of water quality p roblems, the effectiveness \nof management practices, and individual compliance with this Orders requirements.\nTherefore, through the reporting and evaluation of appli ed nitrogen versus removed \nnitrogen, the Management Practices Evaluation Program, developm ent and utilization of \nGroundwater Protection Targets, Surface Water Quality Management Plans, and \nGroundwater Quality Management Plans, the  Third-Party  must evaluate  the effectiveness \nof management practices in protecting water quality. In addition, Membe rs must report \nthe practices they are implementing to protect water quality and comply with Surface and \nGroundwater Quality Management Plans as applicable.

Wast e discharges to surface \nwater include, but are not limited to, irrigation return flows, tailwater, drainage water, subsurface \n(tile) drains, stormwater runoff flowing from irrigated lands, aerial drift, and overspraying of \npesticides. Waste can be dis charged to groundwater through pathways including, but not limited \nto, percolation of irrigation or storm water through the subsurface, backflow of waste into wells \n(e.g., backflow during chemigation), discharges into unprotected wells and dry wells, and \nl eachi ng of waste from tailwater ponds or sedimentation basins to groundwater. A discharge of \nwaste subject to the Order is one that could directly or indirectly reach waters of the state, which \nincludes both surface waters and groundwaters. Direct discharg es may include, for example, \ndischarges directly from piping, tile drains, wells, ditches or sheet flow to waters of the state, or \npercolation of wastes through the soil to groundwater. Indirect discharges may include aerial \ndrift or discharges from one pa rcel to another parcel and then to waters of the state\nAs described in the definition, there exist multiple potential pathways for wastes from irrigated \nlands to waters of the state, where such waste discharge could affect the quality of waters of the \nst ate.  Basic physical processes (e.g., contaminants going into solution in water and gravity) \nresult in water containing waste to flow through soil or other conduits to underlying groundwater \nor result in water flowing over the land surface into surface wate r. In addition, material sprayed \non the crop (such as pesticides) can drift in the wind and reach surface waters. Since farming \ntakes place on landscapes connected to the surrounding environment (an open system), a \nfarmer cannot prevent these physical proc esses from occurring. However, a farmer can take \nsteps to limit the amount of wastes discharged and the subsequent effect on water quality.\nIf an operation believes it is not subject to the requirements of the Order, it may submit a report \nto the Central V alley Water Board describing the waste discharge (e.g., whether there is a \npotential to affect groundwater quality). Upon review of the report, the Central Valley Water \nBoard may choose to waive the requirement to obtain WDRs, issue individual WDRs specifi c to \nthe operation, or seek to enroll the operation under the Order.\nDescription of the Tulare Lake Basin Area\nThe Tulare Lake Basin Area encompasses approximately 2.89 million acres of irrigated \nagricultural lands which are distributed across portions of  Fresno and Kern Counties, and the \nentirety of Tulare and Kings counties (Figure 1). Approximately 350,000 of these acres are \nregulated under the Central Valley Water Board General Order for Existing Milk Cow Dairies. \nThe Tulare Lake Basin Area comprises on e of the most important agricultural centers in the \nUnited States, containing the top three counties in the state for agricultural sales, totaling over \n$15 billion in revenue (California Department of Food and Agriculture, 2011 -2012). The Tulare \nLake Basin  Area  also includes the top three counties in the state for pesticide applications, \ntotaling 69 million pounds of active pesticide ingredients applied during 2010 (California \nDepartment of Pesticide Regulation, 2010 summary data).

The requirement to evaluate materials applied to crops or \nconstituents mobilized by irrigated agricultural o perations will result in monitoring of those \nconstituents in receiving waters. The monitoring sites selected by the  Third-Party  must be \nfully representative of the effects of irrigated agricultural waste di scharges on all receiving \nwaters within the Tulare  Lake Basin (in consideration of potential discharge constituents, \nhydrogeological conditions, and other relevant factors). So as, when taken together, all \nTulare Lake Basin surface waters with the potentia l to receive irrigated agricultural wastes \nmust be  monitored or represented by surface water monitoring sites. The Order requires \nthat any monitoring and follow -up actions (e.g., implementation of practices) triggered by \nresults from a monitoring site will  apply to irrigated agricultural operations in the  \nrepresented upstream watershed, as well as all irrigated agricultural operations \nrepresented by that monitoring site. Through representative site selection and appropriate \nwater quality monitoring, potenti al impacts to all surface water bodies accepting M ember \nwaste discharges are monitored to determine compliance with the Orders conditions;\n2.

This Order requires that currently approved \nManagement Plans continue to be implemented, and any addi tional required Management \nPlans be completed, implemented, and updated once approved.\nSimilar to the previous Order (Coalition Group Co nditional Waiver), this Order requires the \nThird -Party  to develop SQMPs for watersheds where there is an exceedance of a  water quality \nobjective or trigger limit more than one time in a three -year period. SQMPs may also be required \nwhere there is a trend o f degradation that threatens a beneficial use.

As indicated in the summary, this Order \nauthorizes degradation of high quality waters, not to exceed water quality objectives, \nthreaten beneficial uses, or cause a condition of pollution or nuisance. The Order will also \nresu lt in the implementation of  BPTC by those discharging to high quality waters and \nassure that any change in water quality will be consistent with maximum benefit to the \npeople of the state.  For discharges of salt  to surface and groundwaters , participation in the \nPrioritization and Optimization Study (P&O Study)  and implementation of reasonable, \nfeasible, and practicable efforts to  control levels of salt in discharges are  considered to be  \nBPTC. Prior to authorizing the degradation of a high -quality water unde r the Conservative \nPermitting Approach of the Salt Control Program  as described in this Order, the Board \nmust find that allowing degradation by applicable Members better serves the people of the \nstate than their participation in the P&O Study for Phase 1 o f the Salt Control Program.\nCalifornia  Water  Code  Sections 13141 and 13241\n4 5. California Water Code section 13141 states that  prior to implementation of any \nagricultural water quality control program, an estimate of the total cost of such a program, \ntoge ther with an identification of potential sources of financing, shall be indicated in any \nregional water quality control plan.  Section 13141 concerns approvals or revisions to a \nwater quality control plan and does not necessarily apply in a context where a n \nagri cultural water quality control program is being developed through waivers and waste \ndischarge requirements rather than basin planning. However, the Basin Plan includes an \nestimate of potential costs and sources of financing for the long -term irrigate d lands \nprogram. The estimated costs were derived by analyzing the six alternatives evaluated in \nthe PEIR. This Order, which implements the long -term ILRP within the Tulare Lake Basin \nArea, is based on Alternatives 2  through  6 of the PEIR; therefore, estim ated costs of this \nOrder fall within the Basin Plan cost range. 13\nThe total average annual cost of compliance \nwith this Order, e.g., summation of costs for administration, monitoring, reporting, \ntracking, implementation of management practices, is expected  to be approximately \n$8.90 per acre greater than the current surface water only protection program under the \nCoalition Group Conditional Waiver. The total estimated average cost of compliance of \ncontinuation of the previous Coalition Group Conditional Waive r within the Tulare Lake \nBasin Area is expected to be approximately 51.0 million dollars per year ($17.65 per acre \nannually). The total estimated average cost of compliance with this Order is expected to \nbe approximately 76.7 million dollars per year ($26. 55 per acre annually).\nApproximately $20.21 of the estimated $26.55 per acre average annual cost of the Order \nis associated with implementation of management practices. This Order does not require \nthat Members implement specific water quality management pr actices. 14\nMany of the \nmanagement practices that have water quality benefits can have other economic and  13\n \nWhen co mpared on a per irrigated acre basis; as the Basin Plan cost range is an estim ate for \nall irrigated lands in the Central Valley versus this Orders applicability to a portion thereof \n(irrigated lands in Tulare Lake Basin Area). 14\n \nPer California Water Code  section 13360, the Central Valley Water Board may not specify the \nmanner in wh ich a Member complies with water  quality requirements.

Therefore, the surface water monitoring requ ired will allow for a \ndetermination as to whether discharges from irrigated lands are protective of beneficial \nuses and meeting water quality objectives. Other provisions in the MRP will result in the \ngathering of information that will allow the Central Va lley Water Board to evaluate overall \ncompliance wi th the Order;\n5.  Evaluation of the monitoring data collected under the Surface Water Monitoring Plan, in \naddition to any Special Project monitoring required by the Executive Officer, will allow the \nCentral Valley Water Board to determine whether management pr actices representative \nof those implemented by irrigated agriculture are effective.

This monitoring must be representative of the \nirrigated agricultural waste discharges that are potential sources of the water q uality \nproblem. Therefore, the water quality data  gathered, together with management practice \ninformation, will be sufficient to determine whether the management plans are effective.\nThe surface water monitoring required by this Orders Monitoring and Repo rting Program \nR5 -2013 -0120 -0 9 (MRP) has been devel oped using the Conditional Waiver of Waste Discharge \nRequirements for Discharges from Irrigated Lands (Order R5 -2006 -0053), its associated \nMonitoring and Reporting Program Order R5 -2008 -0005, and the SSJVWQ Cs November 2009 \nconditionally approved MRP Plan  as a foundation. However, a number of changes were made \nto address Tulare Lake Basin Area specific conditions and to improve the cost -effectiveness of \nthe surface water monitoring effort while ensuring that  the data collected are the most \nappropriate for a nswering the monitoring questions.\nThe primary changes were to: 1) eliminate the set frequency for monitoring; 2) eliminate the set \nparameter list for metals and pesticides; 3) continue monitoring of exceed ed Assessment \nparameters during Core monitoring; a nd 4) add Ephemeral monitoring to better conform to the \nunique conditions within the Tulare Lake Basin Area.\nThe rationale for the above changes is as follows: "

Core monitoring was designed to evaluate \ngeneral water quality trends over time at the Core sites and included gener al physical \nparameters, nutrients, and pathogens.

In \nac\ncordance with these goals, the objectives of the ILRP are to:\n Restore and\/or maintain appr opriate beneficial uses established in Central Valley \nWater Board water quality control plans by ensuring that all state waters meet \napplicable water quality objectiv es.\n Encourage implementation of management practices that improve water quality \nin keeping  with the first objective, without jeopardizing the economic viability for \nall sizes of irrigated agricultural operations in the Central Valley or placing an \nundue bu rden on rural communities to provide safe drinking water.\n Provide incentives for agricultu ral operations to minimize waste discharge to \nstate waters from their operations.\n Coordinate with other Central Valley Water Board programs, such as the \nGrasslands By pass Project WDRs for agricultural lands total maximum daily load \ndevelopment, CVSALTS, a nd WDRs for dairies.\n Promote coordination with other regulatory and non\t\nregulatory programs \nassociated with agricultural operations (e.g., DPR, the California Department of \nPublic Health [DPH] Drinking Water Program, the California Air Resources B oard \n[ARB ], the California Department of Food and Agriculture, Resource Conservation \nDistricts [RCDs], the University of California Extension, the Natural Resources \nConservation Service [NRCS], the USDA National Organic Program, CACs, State \nWater Board Gro undwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment Program, the U.S. \nGeological Survey [USGS], and local groundwater programs [SB 1938, Assembly \nBill [AB] 3030, and Integrated Regional Water Management Plans]) to minimize \nduplicative regulatory oversight while ens uring program effectiveness.\nCentral Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long -Term Sustainability  \n(CV -SALTS)\nOn  31 May 2018, the Central Valley Water Board adopted  Resolution No. R5 -2018 -0034  which \namended the  Water Quality Control Plan for the Tulare Lake B asin (Basin Plan)  to incorporate \nthe Salt and Nitrate Control Program  for the Central Valley.  A dditional targeted revisions to the \namendments were adopted by the Central Valley Water Board  on 10 December 2020.

Instead of development of separate GQMPs, the Order allows for the submittal of a \ncomprehensive GQMP along with the Groundwater Asse ssment Report. GQMPs will only be \nrequired if irrigated lands may cause or contribute to the groundwater quality problem. GQMPs \nare the key mechanism under this Order to help ensure that waste discharges from irrigated \nlands are meeting Groundwater Receivi ng Water Limitation III.B. The limitations apply \nimmediately unless the Member is implementing the GQMP in accordance with the approved \ntime schedule. The GQMP will include a schedule and milestones for the implementation of \nmanagement practices (see Appen dix MRP-1). The schedule must i dentify the time needed to \nidentify new management practices necessary to meet the receiving water limitations, as well as \na timetable for implementation of identified management practices. The MPEP will be the \nprocess used t o identify the effectiveness of  management practices, where there is uncertainty \nregarding practice effectiveness under different site conditions. However, the GQMP will also be \nexpected to include a schedule for implementing practices that are known to be  effective in \npartially or full y protecting groundwater quality. For example, the ratio of total nitrogen available \nto crop consumption of nitrogen that is protective of water quality may not be known for different \nsite conditions and crops. However, accou nting for the amount of nitrate in irrigation supply \nwater is known to be an effective practice at reducing the amount of excess nitrogen applied.\nThe main elements of GQMPs are to A) investigate potential irrigated agricultural sources of \nwaste discharge  to groundwater, B) review physi cal setting information for the plan area such as \ngeologic factors and existing water quality data, C) considering elements A and B, develop a \nstrategy with schedules and milestones to implement practices to ensure discharge  from irrigated \nlands are meetin g Groundwater Receiving Water Limitation III.B, D) develop a monitoring \nstrategy to provide feedback on GQMP progress, E) develop methods to evaluate data collected \nunder the GQMP, and F) provide reports to the Central Valley  Water Board on progress.\nEleme nts A  F are necessary to establish a process by which the  Third-Party  and Central \nValley Water Board are able to investigate waste sources and the important physical factors in \nthe plan area that may impact management decis ions (elements A and B), implement a process \nto ensure effective practices are adopted by Members (element C), ensure that adequate \nfeedback monitoring is conducted to allow for evaluation of GQMP effectiveness (elements D \nand E), and facilitate efficient  Central Valley Water Board revi ew of data collected on the \nprogress of the GQMP (element F).\nThis Order requires the  Third-Party  to develop GQMPs that include the above elements. \nGQMPs will be reviewed and approved by the Executive Officer.

The \nimplementation o f the program has included compliance and enfo rcement activities to ensure \ngrowers have the proper regulatory coverage and are in compliance with the applicable  Board \norders. The following section describes the state -wide policy followed by the  Board, as w ell as \nhow the  Board intends to implement and  enforce the Order.\nThe State Water Boards Water Quality Enforcement Policy (Enforcement Policy) defines an \nenforcement process that addresses water quality in an efficient, effective, and consistent \nmanner. 13\nA\n variety of enforcement tools are available i n response to noncompliance. The \nEnforcement Policy endorses the progressive enforcement approach which includes an \nescalating series of actions from informal to formal enforcement. Informal enforcement actions \nare any enforcement taken by staff that is no t defined in statute or regulation, such as oral, \nwritten, or electronic communication concerning violations. The purpose of informal enforcement \nis to quickly bring an actual, threatened, or potential violation  to the dischargers attention and to \ngive th e discharger an opportunity to return to compliance as soon as possible. Formal \nenforcement includes statutorily based actions that may be taken in place of, or in addition to, \ninformal enforcement. Formal enfor cement is recommended as a first response to  more \nsignificant violations, such as the highest priority violations, chronic violations, and\/or threatened \nviolations. There are multiple options for formal enforcement, including Administrative Civil \nLiabiliti es (ACLs) imposed by a Regional Water Board o r the State Water Board. A 30-day \npublic comment period is required prior to the settlement or imposition of any ACL and prior to \nsettlement of any judicial civil liabilities.\nCompliance\/Enforcement Related to G rower Participation\nTo facilitate grower part icipation in the Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program (ILRP) under the \nConditional Waiver, the Central Valley Water Board staff engaged in outreach and followed the \nprogressive enforcement series of actions. For e xample, staff had sent outreach postcards \ninf orming non -participating landowners who potentially require coverage under the ILRP. Water \nCode Section 13267 Orders for technical reports had been issued to landowners who first \nreceived an outreach postcard an d did not respond. Landowners were required t o respond to \npostcards or 13267 Orders by obtaining the required regulatory coverage, or claiming an \nexemption from the ILRP requirements. The Central Valley Water Board staff routinely \nconducted inspections to  verify landowner exemption claims; occasional ly the outcome of \ninspections led to an enforcement action for failure to obtain appropriate regulatory coverage.\nUpon the adoption of the Eastern San Joaquin River Watershed Order in December 2012, staff \nsent l etters to thousands of landowners who may now  require regulatory coverage, since like \nthis Order the Eastern San Joaquin River Watershed Order addresses discharge to both \ngroundwater and surface water. Parcels that potentially need regulatory coverage are  identified 13\n \nState Water Resources Control Board. 2010.

Approximately 16,000 public \nsupply wells were sampled; of these, 616 wells were identified as having nitrate concentrations \nabove the MCL. Nitrate impacts in the Tulare  Lake Basin Area (from south to north) appear as a \ndis continuous band of high nitrate groundwater extending northwestward from southern Kern \nCounty along the eastern side of the valley to the southern end of Madera County.\nA Revised Groundwater Information  Sheet for Nitrate\/Nitrite was issued by the State Wat er \nBoard in February 2008. The revised information sheet utilized California Department of Public \nHealth data from 1994 forward to evaluate nitrate impacts in approximately 15,000 active and \nstandby publ ic drinking water wells throughout California. Eight  hundred and fifty-two (852) wells \nwere identified as having nitrate concentrations above the MCL value. The band of impacted \ngroundwater observed in the 2002 study is shown to have broadened and forms a  more \ncontinuous arc from Bakersfield northward into s outhern Madera County.\nIn 2003, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) prepared a report entitled  Framework for \na Ground -Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Program for California  (GAMA). The report \ncites Assembly Bill 599, (\"Ground -Water Quality Monitoring Act of 2001\" ) as identifying the need \nfor developing and maintaining a monitoring program to assess the quality of California's \ngroundwater. The major groundwater supply basins  are a specific focus of the GAMA program.\nThe GAMA program was divided into four projects: Priority Basin Project, Domestic Well Project, \nSpecial Studies Project, and GeoTracker GAMA Project. The Priority Basin Project was \ndesigned to provide a spatially unbiased assessment of raw groundwater quality within specific \ngroundwater basins\/sub -basins, as well as to provide a statistically consistent basis for \ncomparing water quality between basins throughout California. Samples were collected from \nwater supply wells in each basin\/sub -basin using a randomized grid -based method to  provide \nstatistical representation of the study unit (grid wells). Additional wells were selected to evaluate \nchanges in water chemistry along selected lateral or vertical groundwater flo w paths in the \naquifer (flow- path wells).\nThe results of the chemical  analyses for nitrate in groundwater collected by the Priority Basin \nProject for the Tulare Lake Basin Area are as follows:\n1. Kern County Sub -basin  - 2 out of 17 samples had a nitrate conce ntration that exceeded \nthe nitrate MCL value (sample set included 14  wells and 3 flow-path wells) and\n2.  Southeast San Joaquin Valley  - 6 out of 44 samples had a nitrate concentration that \nexceeded the nitrate MCL value (28 wells and 16 flow -path wells). All  six detections that \nexceeded the nitrate MCL value occurred in flow -p ath wells.\nFigure 5 shows the nitrate concentrations obtained from the GAMA domestic well sampling \nprogram conducted in Tulare County. One hundred and eighty -one (181) domestic wells were  \nsampled; seventy -five (75) of which exceeded the nitrate MCL value ( 41%). "

The benefits of representative monitoring \ninclude the ability to determine whether water bodies accepting discharges from numerous \nirri gated lands are meeting water quality objectives (e.g., th rough selection of representative \nsampling locations and representative MPEP studies). Representative monitoring also allows \nthe Central Valley Water Board to determine whether practices are protect ive of water quality. \nThere are limitations to  representative monitoring when trying to determine possible sources of \nwater quality problems.\nTherefore, through the Management Practices Evaluation Program and the Surface Water \nQuality Management Plans and  Groundwater Quality Management Plans, the  Third-Party  must \nevaluate the effectiveness of management practices in protecting water quality. In addition, \nMembers must report the practices they are implementing to protect water quality. Through the \nevaluation s and studies conducted by the  Third-Party , the reporting of practices by the \nMembers, and the  Boards compliance and enforcement activities, the  Board will be able to \ndetermine whether a Member is complying with the Order.\nAn effective method of determini ng compliance with water quality objectives is  water quality \nmonitoring at the individual level. Individual monitoring may also be used to help determine \nsources of water quality problems. Individual monitoring of waste discharges is required under \nmany ot her Water Board programs. Examples of such prog rams include regulation of \nwastewater treatment plants and the Central Valley Water Boards Dairy Program. 12\nThe costs \nof individual monitoring would be much higher than regional and representative surface and \ngroundwater quality monitoring required under  the Order. This is because representative \nmonitoring site selection may be based on a group or category of represented waste \ndischarges, assessing compliance for represented Members, reducing the number of samp les \nneeded to evaluate compliance with the req uirements of this Order. The Third-Party  is tasked \nwith ensuring that selected monitoring sites are representative of waste discharges from all \nirrigated agricultural operations within the Orders boundaries.\nThis Order requires the Third -Party  to provide  technical reports. These reports may include \nspecial studies at the direction of the Executive Officer. The Executive Officer may require \nspecial studies where representative monitoring is ineffective in determ ining potential sources of \nwater quality probl ems or to identify whether management practices are effective. Special \nstudies help ensure that the potential information gaps described above under the Orders \nrepresentative monitoring requirements may be fil led through targeted technical reports, instead \nof more costly individual monitoring programs. 12\n \nThe dairy program requires individual monitoring of surface water discharges and allows for a \nrepresentative groundwater monitoring in lieu of  individual groundwater monitoring.

The te mplate must be approved by the Executive Officer, \nand will either be proposed by the  Third-Party  according to the criteria listed in the Order, or will \nbe developed by the Central Valley Water Boar d staff in consultation with the Third-Party  based \non those  same criteria. The template should consider, to the extent appropriate, the major \ncriteria established in Code 590 of the NRCS Nutrient Management document, including soil \nand plant tissue testing, nitrogen application rates, nitrogen application timing,  consideration of \norganic nitrogen fertilizer, consideration of irrigation water nitrogen levels to minimize surface \nand groundwater pollution and meet crop nitrogen requirements and crop yield pote ntial.\nAll Members will be required to complete a nitrogen  management plan according to the \nschedule in the Order. Growers in low vulnerability areas are required to prepare nitrogen \nmanagement plans, but do not need to certify the plans or provide summary  reports to the  Third-\nParty . Should the groundwater vulnera bility designation change from low to  high  vulnerability, \nthose Members in the previously designated low vulnerability area would then need to have their \nnitrogen management plan certified and  submit summary reports in accordance with a schedule \nissued  by the Executive Officer. 8\n \nICF International. 2011.

The basin is normally a hydrologically closed \nbasin exce pt during periods of above average surface water flows, when flood control waters \nare diverted out of the basin through Fresno Slough and James Bypass into the San Joaquin \nRiver. Additional diversions both within the basin and out of the basin occur as wat er transfers \nand exchanges via the Cross Valley Canal to the California Aqueduct (U.S. Bureau of \nReclamation, 2008).\nThe San Joaquin, Kings, Kaweah, Tule, and Kern rivers drain the west face of the Sierra \nNevada mountain range and provide the bulk of the s urface water supply native to the basin. \nThese rivers have produced a broad, extensive network of alluvial fans which drained into \ntopographically closed sinks, such as Tulare Lake, Kern Lake, and Buena Vista Lake. In \naddition to the native supply, importe d surface water enters into the Tulare Lake Basin through \nthe San Luis Canal\/California Aqueduct System, Friant -Kern Canal, and Delta -Mendota Canal.\nThe natural hydrology of the Tulare Lake Basin Area has been extensively modified over the last \n150 years.  Channelization of the areas rivers and streams coupled with development of a vast \nsystem of irrigation canals and ditches allow for the transfer and mixing of surface waters from a \nvariety of different sources (e.g., the water contained in Cross Creek [we st of Visalia] may be \nfrom the Kings River, the Kaweah River, the Friant -Kern Canal [San Joaquin River water], \nCottonwood Creek or a mixture of these waters).\nThe Tulare Lake Basin Area includes all or portions of 17 groundwater basins\/sub -basins \n(Figure 2 ).; however, the majority of irrigated agricultural activities occur in the Central Valley, \nwith minor or no activity in the smaller basins within the surrounding Sierra Nevada, Tehachapi \nMountains, and Coast Ranges.\nSediments in the eastern part of the Ce ntral Valley are derived from crystalline granitic rocks of \nthe Sierra Nevada. The sediments typically consist of highly permeable medium - to coarse -\ngrained sands with low total organic carbon, and form broad alluvial fans where the streams \nenter the valle y. These deposits generally are coarsest near the upper parts of the alluvial fans \nand finest near the valley trough (Page, 1986). The alluvial deposits of the western part of the \nvalley are derived from the marine sedimentary deposits that comprise the Co ast Ranges and \ntend to be of finer texture relative to those of the eastern part of the valley and have higher clay \ncontent. Lacustrine and marsh deposits exist beneath the Buena Vista, Kern and Tulare Lake \nbeds and along the western flank of the valley. T hese deposits are composed primarily of silts \nand clays with sand interbeds. The most laterally continuous of these units have been \ndesignated from the youngest to oldest by the letters A through F. The most prominent of \nthese clay units is the modified E  Clay or Corcoran Clay Member of the Tulare Formation \n(Corcoran Clay) which extends throughout the majority of western and southern Tulare Lake \nBasin (absent along the eastern boundary and in the Bakersfield area). The Corcoran Clay \ngenerally separates unco nfined groundwater conditions above the clay from confined \nconditions below the clay (Figure 3). This results in two zones with distinctly different \ngroundwater chemistries (Page, 1968). "

The Draft \nPEIR was released in July 2010, and the Final PEIR was certified by the  Board in April 2011 \n(referred to th roughout as  PEIR). In June 2011, the  Board directed Central Valley Water Board \nstaff to begin developing waste discharge requirements (orders) that would implement the long -\nterm ILRP to protect surface and groundwater quality. During 2011, the  Board reco nvened the \nStakeholder Advisory Workgroup to provide additional input in the development of the orders. \nAlso, during the same time, the  Board worked with the Groundwater Monitoring Advisory \nWorkgroup to develop an approach for groundwater monitoring in the  ILRP.\nThe  Boards intent is to develop seven geographic and one commodity -specific general waste \ndischarge requirements (general orders) within the Central Valley region for irrigated lands \nowners\/operators that are part of a  Third-Party  group. In additio n, the  Board intends to develop \na general order for irrigated lands owners\/operators that are not part of a  Third-Party  group. \nTowards this goal, on 7 December 2012 the B oard adopted Waste Discharge Requirements \nGeneral Order for Growers within the Eastern  San Joaquin River Watershed that are Members \nof the  Third-Party  Group, Order R5 -2012 -0116.\nThe geographic\/commodity -based orders will allow for tailoring of implementation requirements \nbased on the specific conditions within each geographic area. At the sa me time, the Board \nintends to maintain consistency in the general regulatory approach acros s the orders through \nthe use of templates for grower reporting, as well as in the focus on high vulnerability areas and \nareas with known water quality issues. The Or der includes provisions to reduce the reporting \nrequirements for small farming operations a nd areas of low vulnerability.\nGoals and Objectives of the Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program\nThe goals and objectives of this Order, which implements the long term  ILRP in the Tulare Lake \nBasin Area, are described below. These are the goals described in t he PEIR for the ILRP. 3\nUnderstanding that irrigated agriculture in the Central Valley provides valuable food and fiber \nproducts to communities worldwide, the overal\nl goals of the ILRP are to (1) restore and\/or \nmaintain the highest reasonable quality of s tate waters considering all the demands being \nplaced on the water; (2) minimize waste discharge from irrigated agricultural lands that could \ndegrade the quality of st ate waters; (3) maintain the economic viability of agriculture in \nCalifornias Central Val ley; and (4) ensure that irrigated agricultural discharges do not impair 1\n \nICF International. 2 011.

The  Third-Party  will be required to evaluate \npesticid e use patterns and peak times when pesticides\/metals from irrigated agriculture \noperations may c ause problems in surface water. Based on that evaluation, the  Third-\nParty  will propose a frequency and time period to conduct monitoring that will adequately \nch aracterize surface waters receiving irrigated agricultural waste discharges;\n2.  The set list of par ameters resulted in monitoring of some pesticides and metals that are \nunlikely to result in water quality problems. Also, in some cases pesticides that could be  \ndischarged and cause or contribute to a water quality problem were not monitored. The \nThird -Par ty will be required to evaluate use patterns and properties (e.g., physical -\nchemical characteristics) and propose a list of metals to monitor. Central Valley Wa ter \nBoard staff will work with DPR to develop a list of pesticides for monitoring by the  \nThird -P arty ;\n3.  The previous requirement for Core monitoring did not include provisions for continued \nmonitoring of Assessment parameters (pesticides and metals) that exc eeded a water \nquality objective or trigger limit during the preceding Assessment monitoring peri od. This \nlack of information during Core monitoring limits the ability to evaluate water quality \ntrends over time, which is needed to assess the effectiveness o f management practices \nthat may reduce or eliminate discharges contributing to the exceedance. I n addition, \ncontinued monitoring of exceeding Assessment parameters during Core monitoring may \nbe needed to trigger a Management Plan if discharges of the excee ding constituent are \nonly prevalent within a single month. The previous requirements would not r e-analyze the \nexceeding constituent until the following Assessment period, which is outside of the \nthree -year timeframe for triggering a Management Plan; and\n4.  Th e addition of Ephemeral monitoring will address the unique nature of the Tulare Lake \nBasin Areas surface water systems which include heavily modified natural waterways, a \nlarge number of controlled constructed water conveyance features (canals), and the \ng eneral ephemeral nature of the majority of the regions streams.\nThis Orders MRP requires the de velopment of a Surface Water Monitoring Plan which will \nutilize four different but interrelated types of surface water monitoring sites: 1) fixed, long -term \nCor e sites (as in the previous program), 2) Assessment sites (previous program), 3) Ephemeral \nsites  (new), 4) Special Project sites (previous program), and the use of Representative \nmonitoring (previous program).

Constructed conveyance structures (e.g., Friant -Kern Canal, Homeland Canal, Lakeside \nDitch, and Westside Canal) which are used to move waters of  the state throughout the \nregion (not intended to apply to on farm conveyance structures) for ir rigation purposes \nand have the potential to be impacted by agricultural operations (spray drift, tailwater, tile \ndrainage, or storm water flows).\nCore Monitorin g\nCore monitoring sites will continue to be used to track trends in water quality over time. The  \nthree -year period of monitoring for Core sites remains the same as the previous monitoring \nschedule, with each Core site being sampled on a rotating basis cons isting of one year of \nAssessment monitoring parameters followed by two years of Core monitoring  parameters, with \nthe cycle then repeated. In addition to the required Core monitoring parameters provided in the \nMonitoring and Reporting Program, Core monitori ng sites will also be monitored for any \nparameters that exceeded a water quality objective or tr igger limit during the preceding \nAssessment monitoring period through the first year of  Core monitoring. The frequency of \nmonitoring (monthly, irrigation season \/storm season or other) will now be proposed by the  Third-\nParty  for each Core site (for both Cor e and Assessment parameters). The proposed frequency \nis to be based upon site conditions (presence or absence of surface water or change in the \nsource of water  [natural stream flow vursus irrigation waters introduced into the channel from off \nstream reserv oirs or canals], crop types [permanent crops, row crops, etc.] and crop \nrequirements [timing of irrigation, timing of nutrient and pesticide applications]). Thi s approach \nwill ensure that each Core site will undergo periodic comprehensive Assessment monito ring \nnecessary to allow Central Valley Water Board to track and identify any significant changes, \nwhile still gathering trend information and not imposing an un due cost burden.\nAssessment Monitoring\nAssessment monitoring will be conducted for the period of  one year at all newly established sites. \nThe monitoring will be repeated on a regular basis with the period of rotation to be proposed by \nthe  Third -Party . Rotation will be continuous so that any given water body will be reassessed on a \nregular basis. This  strategy will allow for the characterization of a large number of water bodies \nthroughout the  Third-Party  area over time. Regardless of the rotation freq uency, the Third-Party  \nmust choose sites that are representative to ensure characterization of all sim ilar surface water \nbodies receiving irrigated agricultural wastes within the  Third-Party  area. Representative \nAssessment sites will be selected considering similarities in hydrology, crop types, pesticide use, \nand other factors that affect the discharge of  wastes from irrigated lands to surface waters.\nEphemeral Monitoring\nA large number of ephemeral streams that may be impacted by agricultural operations ( e.g., \nspray drift, tailwater flows, and\/or storm water runoff) are present in the western, eastern and  \nsouthern portions of the Tulare Lake Basin Area.

The use of existi ng wells is less costly than \ninstalling wells specifically designed for groundwater monitoring, while still yielding data which \ncan be compared with historical and future data to evaluate long -term groun dwater trends.\nAs the management practices identified  as protective of groundwater quality through the MPEP \nare implemented, the trend monitoring, together with other data included in updates to the GAR, \nshould show improvements in water quality. The trend  monitoring and GAR updates will, \ntherefore, provide  a regional view as to whether the collective efforts of Members are resulting in \nwater quality improvements. If groundwater quality trends indicate degradation in low \nvulnerability areas, then a Groundwa ter Quality Management Plan must be developed and \nimp lemented. Negative trends of groundwater quality in high vulnerability areas over time would \nbe an indicator that the existing Groundwater Quality Management Plan is not effective or is not \nbeing effecti vely implemented.\nThe  Third -Party  may also look to an d explore using existing monitoring networks such as those \nbeing conducted in accordance with local groundwater management plans (e.g., AB 3030, SB \n1938, Integrated Regional Water Management Plans).\nGMAW  question 3, which seeks to differentiate sources of  existing impact, cannot be easily \nanswered by traditional groundwater monitoring. The MPEP and trend monitoring will help to \nanswer this question, but other methods such as isotope tracing and groundwate r age \ndetermination may also be necessary to fully di fferentiate sources. The MRP does not require \nthese advanced source methods because they are not necessary to determine compliance with \nthe Order. The MPEP will be used to help determine whether waste di scharge at represented \nsites is of high enough qualit y to meet the groundwater limitations of the Order.\nThrough the MPEP, the potential impacts of irrigated agriculture waste discharges to \ngroundwater will be assessed for different types of practices and  site conditions, representative \nof discharge conditio ns throughout the Tulare Lake Basin Area. In this way, the  Board will \nevaluate whether waste discharges from irrigated agricultural operations are protective of \ngroundwater quality throughout the Tulare  Lake Basin Area. Where the MPEP finds that \nadditional  protective  practices must be implemented in order to ensure that Member waste \ndischarges are in compliance with the Orders receiving water limitations, the Order requires \nMembers to implement such pr actices, or equivalent practices. This representative  MPEP \nprocess will ensure that the effects of waste discharges are evaluated and where necessary, \nadditional protective practices are implemented.\nData Summary, Pesticides\nMonitoring data collected for t wo studies conducted by the State Water Resources Con trol \nBoard (State Water Board) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 2006 showed \ndetections of pesticides used by agriculture in groundwater within the Tulare Lake Basin Area \n(Burton, and Bel itz, 2006), and (Shelton, et al., 2006). Pesticides a nd pesticide degradates were \ndetected in greater than 50 percent of wells (46 wells of 83 wells sampled) in the southeastern \nSan Joaquin Valley (study area entirely contained within the Tulare Lake Basin  Area) in 2006, \nand 60 percent of wells (30 wells of  50 wells samples) in the Kern County Subbasin Study Unit \nin 2006.

Depending on \nirrigation method, water use, geography, ge ology, climate, and the constituents (e.g., nutrients, \npesticides, pathogens) present or used at a site, water discharged from the site may carry these \nconstituents as waste off site and into groundwater or surface waters.\nThe Central Valley Water Boards  Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program (ILRP) was initiated in \n2003 with the adoption of a conditional waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for discharges \nfrom irrigated lands. The 2003 conditional waiver was renewed in 2006, and again in 2011. The \ncondition al waivers requirements are designed to reduce wastes discharged from irrigated \nagricultural sites (e.g., tailwater, runoff from fields, subsurface drains) to Central Valley surface \nwaters (Central Valley Water Board 2011).\nIn addition to providing condit ions, or requirements, for discharge of waste from irrigated \nagricultural lands to surface waters, the Central Valley Water Boards conditional waiver \nincluded direction to Central Valley Water Board staff to develop an environmental impact report \nfor a lo ng-term ILRP that would protect waters of the state (groundwater and surface water) \nfrom discharges of waste from irrigated lands. Although the requirements of the conditional \nwaiver are aimed to protect surface water bodies, the directive to develop a lon g-term ILRP and \nenvironmental impact report is not as limited, as waters of the State include ground and surface \nwaters within the State of California ( California Water Code, Section 13050[e]).\nThe Central Valley Water Board completed an  Existing Conditions Report  (ECR) for Central \nValley irrigated agricultural operations in December 2008. The ECR was developed to \nestablish baseline conditions for estimating potential environmental and economic effects of \nlong -term ILRP alternatives in a program environment al impact report (PEIR) and other \nassociated analyses.\nIn fall 2008, the Central Valley Water Board convened the Long -Term ILRP Stakeholder \nAdvisory Workgroup (Workgroup). The Workgroup included a range of stakeholder interests \nrepresenting local governmen t, industry, agricultural coalitions, and environmental\/  \nenvironmental justice groups throughout the Central Valley. The main goal of the Workgroup \nwas to provide Central Valley Water Board staff with input on the development of the long -term \nILRP. Central  Valley Water Board staff and the Workgroup developed long -term program goals \nand objectives and a range of proposed alternatives for consideration in a PEIR and \ncorresponding economic analysis. In August 2009 the Workgroup generally approved the goals,  "

The narrative toxicity \nobjective states:  All waters shall be maintained free of toxic substances in concentrations that \nproduce detrimental physiological responses in human, plant, animal, or aquatic life.  The \nBa sin Plan state s that material and relevant information, including numeric criteria, and \nrecommendations from other agencies and scientific literature will be utilized in evaluating \ncompliance with the narrative toxicity objective. The narrative chemical co nstituent objective \nstates that waters shall not contain chemical constituents in concentrations that adversely \naffect beneficial uses.  At a minimum,  water designated for use as domestic or municipal \nsupply (MUN) shall not contain  concentrations of chemical constituen ts in excess of the \nmaximum contaminant levels (MCLs)  in Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR). \nThe Basin Plan further states that, to protect all beneficial uses, the Regional Water Board may \napply limi ts more stringent than MCLs. The narr ative tastes and odors objective states:  Water \nshall not contain taste - or odor -producing substances in concentrations that cause nuisance, \nadversely affect beneficial uses, or impart undesirable tastes or odors to fis h flesh or other \nedible products of a quatic origin or to domestic or municipal water supplies.\nPage IV -21 of the Tulare Lake Basin Plan, contains an implementation policy,  Application of \nWater Quality Objectives , that specifies that the Central Valley W ater Board will, on a case -by -\ncase b asis, adopt numerical limitations in orders which will implement the narrative objectives.  \nWith respect to narrative objectives, the Regional Water Board must establish limitations using \none or more of three specified  sources, including: (1) USEPAs publi shed water quality criteria, \n(2) a proposed state criterion (i.e., water quality objective) or an explicit state policy interpreting \nits narrative water quality criteria (i.e., the Regional Water Boards  Policy for Application of \nWater Quality Objectives ), or (3) an indicator parameter. For purposes of this Order, all three \nsources will be used as part of the process described below.\nImplementation of numeric and narrative water quality objectives under the Order invol ves an \niterative process. The Orders  MRP establishes management plan trigger limits that are \nequivalent to the applicable Basin Plan numeric water quality objectives. For constituents that \nare not assigned Basin Plan numeric water quality objectives, Cent ral Valley Water Board staff \nwill dev elop trigger limits in consultation with the Department of Pesticide Regulation (for \npesticides) and other agencies as appropriate. Central Valley Water Board staff will provide \ninterested parties, including the  Third-P arty  representing Members, with an op portunity to review \nand comment on the trigger limits. The Executive Officer will then provide the trigger limits to the \nThird -Party . Those trigger limits will be considered the numeric interpretation of the applicable \nnarrative objectives. In locations wh ere trigger limits are exceeded, water quality management \nplans must be developed that will form the basis for reporting which steps have been taken by \ngrowers to achieve compliance with numeric and narrative water qual ity objectives.\nUnder  Phase I of  the conservative salinity permitting approach described in this Order, w hen the \nmost salinity sensitive beneficial use is AGR or MU N the Central Valley Water Board will apply \nspecific numeric limits identified in the Basin  Plan. These limits are for use only u nder the \nconservative salinity permitting approach and shall not be considered water quality objectives.  \nFor surface and groundwaters for which site -specific numeric water quality objectives have been \ndeveloped, the sit e -\nspecific objectives shall apply.

The GeoTracker GAMA system is an online database that uses Goog le \nMaps and data bases generated by State and Regional Water Boards ( SWRCB\/RWQCB), \nCalifornia Department of Public Health (CDPH), Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR), \nDepartment of Water Resources (DWR), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and \nLaw rence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The GeoTracker GAMA syste m provides \ndata for over 100,000 sampling locations and analytical results for a variety of constituents \nincluding nitrate.\nA variety of investigators have looked at the San Joaquin Valle y groundwater nitrate \nconcentrations over time (Burow et al, 1998, 20 07, and 2008; Rupert, 2008; and Rosen and \nLapham, 2008). In 1995, NAWQA (Burow, et al 1998) resampled 30 domestic supply wells in \nthe eastern San Joaquin Valley that had previously been s ampled by the U.S. Geological \nSurvey between 1986 and 1987. The media n nitrate concentration for 23 of the 30 wells in \n1986 87 was 2.4 mg\/L, (seven wells had no nitrate sample data) and in 1995 the median \nconcentration for the full 30 wells was 4.6 mg\/L. N itrate exceeded the MCL value in two wells in \n1986 -87 and in five wel ls in 1995.\nIn 2002,  twenty-nine  of the original 30 domestic wells within the regional aquifer were resampled \nfor the third time (Burow, et al, 2008). The median nitrate concentration for the resampled wells \nhad risen from 2.3 mg\/L in 1986 -87 to 5.4 mg\/L i n 2003. Burow and others (2008)  concluded \nthat,  The results of the analysis of regional - and local -scale nitrate concentration data indicate \nthat widespread high concentrations of nitrate in the shallow part of the San Joaquin Aquifer \nsystem are likely to  move to deeper parts of the gro und-water flow system.\nThe trend of nitrate concentrations in the shallow groundwater portion of the Eastern San \nJoaquin Study Area has also been investigated by means of focused studies utilizing monitoring \nwells in three  geographical areas: near Fresno,  near Modesto, and near the Merced River \n(Burow and Green, 2008). Nitrogen fertilizer data were coupled with the results of groundwater \nsampling to show that nitrate concentrations increased over time; corresponded to fertil izer \napplication rates in all th ree focus study areas. Burow and Green (2008) reported that,  Analysis \nusing county -level nitrogen applications and a wide range of chemical data from sampling \nvertical monitoring well transects showed that reconstructed nit rate concentrations are \nconsiste nt with 50% of the applied nitrogen reaching the water table.\nBurow and others (2007) produced a report that expanded upon the data evaluation for the \nfocused study areas of the Eastern San Joaquin Study Area. This study re ported that the nitrate \nconcentr ations in monitoring wells completed in the shallowest part of the aquifer increased in \nconcentration from 8 to 23 mg\/L as NO 3 \nduring the period of time from 1994 -1995 to 2003. \nNitrate concentrations varied considerably with  groundwater depth ranging from  2mg\/L in the \ndeepest monitoring wells to 30 to 40 mg\/L in the shallow wells. This change in concentration \nverses depth is due in part to the age of the groundwater. Based upon chlorinated fluorocarbons \nconcentrations (CFC),  groundwater less than 10 meters  (m) below the water table is  "

In addition to addressing the widespread nitrate pro blems, the presence of nitrates in \ngroundwater at elevated levels would serve as an indicator of other potential problems \nassociated wit h irrigated agricultural practices.

These data are \nrequired to be associated with the  township (36 square mile area) where the farm is located. \nThe spatial resolution by township provides a common unit that should facilitate analysis of data \nand comparisons between different areas.\nThe nitrogen management data collected by the  Third-Party  from individual Members will be \naggregated by the township where the enrolled parcel is located and will not be associated \nwith the Member or their enrolled parcel. For example, the  Third-Party  may  have information \nsubmitted for 180 different parcels in a g iven township. At a minimum, the Board would receive \na statistical summary of those 180 data records describing the range, percentiles (10th, 25th, \n50th, 75th, 90th), and any outliers for similar  soil conditions and similar crops in that township. \nA box an d whisker plot or equivalent tabular or graphical presentation of the data approved by \nthe Executive Officer may be used. Based on this analysis, the Central Valley Water Board \nintends to work wit h the Third-Party  to ensure that those Members who are not m eeting the \nnitrogen management performance standards identified in the Order improve their practices. \nAs part of its annual review of the monitoring report submitted by the  Third-Party , the Board \nwill evaluate the effectiveness of  Third-Party  outreach effo rts and trends associated with \nnitrogen management. The  Board intends to request information from the  Third-Party  for those \nMembers who, based on the  Boards evaluation of available information, d o not appear to be \nmeeting nitrogen management performance standards. The reporting of nitrogen management \ndata may be adjusted based on the outcomes of the efforts of the State Water Resources \nControl Boards Expert Panel and the California Department of  Food and Agricultures Nitrogen \nTracking and Reporting Syste m Task Force (see Finding 51 and the State Water Boards \nReport to the Legislature 10\n).\nIn order to determine whether growers in a given township are improving their practices, the \nThird -Party  will need to assess the data and evaluate trends. The  Third-Party s assessment and \nevaluation, along with the data used to make the evaluation, will be  provided in the  Third-Party s \nannual monitoring report.

The mean age of groundwater deeper than 60m below the water \ntable is approximately 45 years old (Burow et al, 2007). Burow and others concluded that,\nNitrate concentrations were highest and most var iable in the shallow \nmonitoring wells in the regional areal monitoring  networks; the variability in \nnitrate concentrations and median values decreased with depth.  Because of \nintensive pumping and irrigation recharge, the dom inant groundwater flow paths \nin  the aquifer system are vertically downward.  High concentrations in the \nshallow part of the aquifer could be expected to move downward over time, \nwhich would result in increasing concentrations in the deeper domestic and \npublic- supply wells in the future as  water with high nitrate concentrations moves \ndeeper in the groundwater system.\nIn March of 2012, Harter and others released a report entitled Addressing Nitrate in Californias \nDrinking Water which was prepared for the Sta te Water Board. The document focused on the \nTulare Lake Basin and the Salinas Valley evaluating the nitrate concentrations for 100,000 \ngroundwater samples from nearly 20,000 wells across the two regions. The report concluded \nthat,  Of the 20,000 wells, 2,5 00 are frequently sampled public  water supply wells (over 60,000 \nsamples). In these public supply wells, about 1 in 10 raw water samples exceed the nitrate \nMCL . The predominant source of the nitrate in groundwater was deemed to be agricultural \nfertilizers  and animal waste applied to cro plands.\nThe Harter and others (2012) report also provided an evaluation of household self -supplied and \nlocal small water supply systems in the Tulare Lake Basin and the Salinas Valley that are \nimpacted by nitrate concentrati ons. The report found that,\nSev erely disadvantaged communities (SDACs) are particularly vulnerable to \nfinancial costs.  Of 51 community public water systems (serving about 714,000 \npeople) in the study area with a raw source  exceeding the nitrate MCL, most  \nsystems (40, serving about 379, 000 people) are in a DAC. Thirteen of the 40 \nexceeding systems are in unincorporated areas (serving about 167,000 people), \nand 27 are in incorporated communities (serving about 212,000 people).\nIn February 2012, the State W ater Board issued a draft report  to the legislature: Communities \nThat Rely on Contaminated Groundwater.

Similar to the Coalition Group Conditional Waiver, this \nOrder has be\nen written for a  Third-Party  to provide a lead role in conducting monitoring, \neducating member growers (Members), developing water quality management plans, and \ninteracting with the Central Valley Water Board on behalf of Members. Due to a substantial \nnumb er of new requirements, this Order requires that the  Third-Party  submit a new application \nto serve as a  Third-Party  representing growers under this Order if it chooses to continue \nrepresenting Members. This Order will apply to any  Third-Party  within the Tu lare Lake Basin \nArea that receives a NOA from the Executive Officer.\nGrower Enrollment Process\nThe enrollment process whereby growers obtain membership in the  Third-Party  group under this \nOrder is designed to incentivize speedy enrollment by increasing bot h submittal requirements \nand fees due for those who wait to obtain regulatory coverage. Members in good standing when \nthe Order is adopted, as well as growers needing membership, will have a 180 -day period (after \nthe NOA is issued by the Executive Officer for the  Third-Party ) to complete enrollment before \nadditional requirements are initiated. Members in good standing will submit a one -page Notice \nof Confirmation (NOC) to the  Third-Party , confirming that they would like to continue \nmembership in the  Third-P arty  and that they are familiar with the new Orders requirements. \nOther growers will submit a membership application to the  Third-Party  and will be notified by the \nThird -Party  when their membership is approved. This will streamline the initial enro llment \nprocess for the bulk of the irrigated agricultural operations within the Tulare Lake Basin Area.\nGrowers that do not enroll within the 180 -day enrollment period, or are prompted to apply due to \nCentral Valley Water Board enforcement or inspection, w ill be required to submit (1) a Notice of \nIntent (NOI) to comply with the terms and conditions of the Order to the Central Valley Water \nBoard, (2) an administrative processing fee for the increased workload associated with the \ngrower outreach (as applicabl e), and (3) a Membership application to the  Third-Party  group. \nThese additional steps of submitting an NOI and fee directly to the  Board after the initial \nenrollment deadline are intended to provide an incentive for growers to enroll promptly.\nThe  Third -Pa rty wil l provide an annual Membership List to the Central Valley Water Board that \nwill include everyone who enrolled. The Membership List will specify Members in good standing \nas well as revoked memberships or pending revocations. Central Valley Water Boar d staff will \nconduct enforcement activities as needed using the list of revoked\/pending revocations.\nGroundwater Quality Vulnerability\nThe concept of higher and lower vulnerability areas was integrated into the Order to allow the \nCentral Valley Water Board  \nto tai lor requirements to applicable waste discharge conditions. \nResources can be focused on areas that need enhanced water quality protection, because the \nThird -Party  has the option to identify low vulnerability areas where reduced program \nrequirements w ould apply.\nVulnerability may be based on, but is not limited to, the physical conditions of the area (soil type, \ndepth to groundwater, beneficial uses, etc.), water quality monitoring data, and the practices  "

Each farming operation i s unique and requires specific \ndescription and selection of water quality management practices needed to address waste \ndischarges of sediment. The plan must be maintained at the farming opera tions headquarters or \nprimary place of business.\nThe Order  establishes prioritization for Member completion of the plan based on farm size.  \nSmall farming operations will have additional time to complete the plan.\nTo assist Members in determining whether th ey need to prepare a sediment and erosion control \nplan, the  Third -Party  must prepare a sediment and erosion control assessment report that \nidentifies the areas susceptible to erosion and the discharge of sediment that could impact \nreceiving waters.  In addi tion, the Executive Officer may identify areas requiring su ch plans \nbased on evidence of ongoing erosion or sediment control problems.\nSmall Farming Operations\nIn counties within Tulare Lake Basin Area, small farming operations are operated by \napproximatel y 58 percent of the growers, but account for approximately  4.6% of the total \nirrigated lands. 11\nDuring the development of the Order, concerns were raised regarding the \nability of small farms to comply with the requirements of the Order. Although there were \nrecommendations to exempt small farms from this Order, no  evidence was provided to \ndemonstrate that small farms could not affect water quality and, therefore, justify an exemption \nfrom being governed by waste discharge requirements. In addition, there was  no evidence \npresented to suggest that, on a per acre basis , small farming operations would have a reduced \nimpact on water quality then larger farmers.\nHowever, the Central Valley Water Board recognizes that small farming operations have more \nlimited resources and access to technical experts. The additional time p rovided for small farming \noperations to initially prepare applicable farm evaluations, nitrogen management plans, and \nsediment and erosion control plans should allow small farmers to more feasibly a ccess available \ntechnical resources, such as their  Third-P arty , the Natural Resources Conservation Service, \nUniversity of California Cooperative Extension, and local resource conservation districts.\nThese changes should not impact the Central Valley Water  Boards ability to determine progress \nfor the watershed as  a whole, since most of the irrigated acreage in the watershed is managed \nby large farming operations. However, small farming operations may prove to have significant \nlocalized impacts, so this Orde r does not preclude the Executive Officer from obtaining \ni nformation from small farming operations to address such impacts.\nTo accommodate differing requirements for small farming operations, the Central Valley Water \nBoard needs to know who is farming a gi ven parcel. Although the landowner can be the Member \nof th e Third -Party , the landowner must still identify the lessee, if the landowner is not also the \nfarmer.

The \nThird-Party  must collect sufficient data to descr ibe \nirrigated agricultural impacts on groundwater quality and to determine whether existing or newly \nimplemented management practices co mply with the groundwater receiving water limitations of \nthe Order. The strategy for evaluating groundwater quality and  protection consists of: 1) a \nGroundwater Quality Assessment Report (GAR), 2) a Management Practices Evaluation \nProgram, and 3) a Groundw ater Quality Trend Monitoring Program.\nThe general purpose of the GAR is to analyze existing monitoring data and provide  the \nfoundation for designing the Management Practices Evaluation Program and the Groundwater \nQuality Trend Monitoring Program, as well  as identifying high vulnerability groundwater areas \nwhere a groundwater quality management plan must be developed and im plemented.\nA Management Practices Evaluation Program (MPEP) is to be developed where known \ngroundwater quality impacts exist for which i rrigated agricultural operations are a potential \ncontributor or where conditions make groundwater more vulnerable to imp acts from irrigated \nagricultural activities (high vulnerability areas). The purpose of the MPEP is to identify whether \nexisting site -spe cific and\/or commodity -specific agricultural management practices are \nprotective of groundwater quality in the high vuln erability areas and to assess the effectiveness \nof any newly implemented management practices instituted to improve groundwater quality.  \nGiven the wide range of management practices\/commodities within the  Third-Party s \nboundaries, it is anticipated that th e Third -Party  will rank or prioritize its high vulnerability areas \nand commodities, and present a phased approach to implementing the M PEP. The MPEP must \nbe designed to answer GMAW questions 2, 5, 6, and 7. Where applicable, management \npractices identifie d as protective of groundwater quality through the MPEP (or equivalent \npractices) must be implemented by Members, whether the Member is  in a high or low \nvulnerability area (see section IV. C.21 of the Order).\nSince the focus of the MPEP is answering the que stions related to management practices, the \nmethod or tools to be used are not prescribed by the Central Valley Water Board. The  Third-\nP arty  is required to develop a workplan that describes the tools or methods to be used to \nassociate management practice a ctivities on the land surface with the effect of those activities \non underlying groundwater quality. The Central Valley Water Board anti cipates that the MPEP \nworkplan will likely propose using a variety of tools, such as vadose zone monitoring, modeling, \na nd groundwater monitoring. The  Third-Party  has the option of developing the workplan as part \nof a group effort that may include other ag ricultural water quality coalitions and commodity \ngroups. Such a joint effort may avoid duplication of effort and allow  collective resources to be \nmore effectively focused on the highest priority studies, while ensuring the goals of the MPEP \nare met. Exist ing monitoring wells can be utilized where available for the MPEP.\nThe trend monitoring program is designed to determine  current water quality conditions of \ngroundwater in the  Third-Party  area, and to develop long -term groundwater quality information \nthat can be used to evaluate the regional effects (i.e., not site -specif ic effects) of irrigated \nagriculture and its practice s. Trend monitoring has been developed to answer GMAW questions 1 \nand 4. At a minimum, trend monitoring must include annual monitoring for electrical conductivity, \npH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, nitr ate as nitrogen (N), and once every five year monitor ing \nfor total dissolved solids, carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, sulfate, boron, calcium, sodium, \nmagnesium, and potassium.

Most pesticide detections were below \nhealth -based thresholds and applicable water quality objectives.  Analyses were not run for all \npesticides used in  the study areas.\nThe California Department of Pestici de Regulation (DPR), as part of its regulatory requirements \nunder the Pesticide Contamination Prevention Act (PCPA) enacted in 1985, is required to \nmaintain a statewide database of wells sampled for pest icide active ingredients and, in \nconsultation with th e California Department of Public Health (DPH) and the State Water Board, \nprovide an annual report of the data contained in the database and the actions taken to prevent \npesticides contamination to the L egislature and other state agencies. DPR also initiat ed the \nGround Water Protection Program that focuses on evaluating the potential for pesticides to move \nthrough soil to groundwater, improving contaminant transport modeling tools, and outreach\/  \ntraining  programs for pesticide users. There are approximately  981,775 acres of land classified as \nDPR Groundwater Protection Areas within the Tulare Lake Basin Area (See Figure 4). These \ndata will be evaluated by the  Third-Party  as part of its Groundwater Quality  Assessment Report.\nDPR has developed a groundwater mo nitoring system consisting of 75 domestic water wells \nlocated in Tulare and Fresno counties in areas that have been identified as being susceptible to \nthe movement of pesticides to groundwater (based on  soil type and average depth to \ngroundwater). The well s are divided between coarse -grained sections (leaching areas) and \nhardpan sections (runoff areas) and are allotted in the following manner: 33 wells in Fresno \nCounty coarse soil sections, 18 wells in Fr esno County hardpan soil sections, 3 wells in Tulare \nCounty coarse soil sections, and 21 wells in Tulare County hardpan soil sections. All or a portion \nof these wells have been sampled once to twice yearly since 1999. The most recent sampling \nfor which res ults are available (68 wells sampled in March and Apr il of 2011) detected simazine \nin 70% of wells sampled and its degradation products, ACET and DACT, in nearly all the wells. \nAll concentrations were at low levels (less than one part per billion) and did  not exceed \nCalifornia Department of Public Health max imum contaminant levels. Diuron was found in 22% \nof the wells sampled at concentrations less than one part per billion and bromacil was present in \n21% of wells with two wells exceeding one part per billi on (DPR, 2012). Like simazine, diuron \nand bromacil are pre -emergence herbicides.\nDPRs current groundwater quality monitoring program should be sufficient to identify any \nemerging pesticides of concern and to track water quality trends of identified pestic ides of \nconcern. However, the presence of pesticides  in groundwater indicates a discharge of waste \nsubject to Central Valley Water Board regulation. Therefore, should the Central Valley Water \nBoard or DPR identify groundwater quality information needs rela ted to pesticides in \ngroundwater, the Central Valley  Water Board may require the Third-Party  to conduct studies or \nimplement a monitoring plan to address those information needs. Where additional information \ncollected indicates a groundwater quality proble m, a coordinated effort with DPR to address the \nident ified problem will be initiated and the Central valley Water Board may require the  Third-\nParty  to develop a groundwater quality management plan (GQMP).\nData Summary Nitrates\nNitrate derived from both agr icultural and non-agricultural sources has resulted i n degradation of \ngroundwater beneath large areas within Californias Central Valley.

The Central Valley Water Board must be informed of the efforts being undertaken \nby Members to address identified groundwater quality problems. In addition, a regional G QMP is \na reasonable first step  to address identified groundwater quality problems, since the monitoring \nand planning costs are significantly lower when undertaken regionally by the  Third-Party  than \nrequiring individual Members to undertake similar monitori ng and planning efforts.

The benefits and necessity of such individual reporting, when \nregional efforts fail, include, but are not limited to: 1) the need of the Central Valley Water Board \nt o evaluate the compliance of re gulated Members with applicable orders; 2) the need of the \nCentral Valley Water Board to understand the effectiveness of practices being implemented by \nMembers; and 3) the benefits of improved groundwater quality to all users .\nTemplates for Farm Evaluation , Nitrogen Management Plan, \nNitrogen Management Plan Summary Report, and Sediment \nand Erosion Control Plans\nThe Central Valley Water Board intends to provide templates (Farm Evaluation; Nitrogen \nManagement Plan; Nitrogen Mana gement Plan Summary Report; and  Sediment and Erosion \nControl Plan) to all Members that must be used to comply with the applicable reporting \nrequirements of this Order. In issuing Order R5 -2012 -0116, the Central Valley Water Board \nallowed agricultural water  quality coalitions and commodi ty groups to jointly propose templates \nto be used to satisfy the requirements of Order R5 -2012 -0116. The Central Valley Water Board \nunderstands that the Southern San Joaquin Valley Water Quality Coalition and commodity \ngroups  in the Tulare Lake Basin are w orking with the East San Joaquin Water Quality Coalition \nto develop templates. The purposes of the templates are to collect information consistently \nacross irrigated agricultural areas and commodities and to minimize the cost s for growers to \nprovide that i nformation. Consistent information collection will facilitate analysis within a \ngeographic area and across the Central Valley. Those purposes may not be met if the Central \nValley Water Board includes provisions that allows fo r submittal of proposed templates under \neach  Third-Party  order issued as part of the long -term irrigated lands regulatory program. \nHowever, the Central Valley Water Board recognizes that templates may require minor \nmodifications for different geographic ar eas. Therefore, although the Third-Party  will not have an \nopportunity to develop new templates under this Order, the  Third-Party  will have an opportunity \nto provide comments on the templates applicability to their geographic area.\nFarm Evaluations\nThe Ord er requires that all Members complete a farm evaluation describing management \npractices implemented to protect surface and groundwater quality.

For \ngroundwater protection practices, it may take years in many areas (even decades in some areas) \nbefore broad trends in groundwater may be measured and associated with implementation of this \nOrder.

One of the key ways to extrapolate those \nresults will be to have an understanding of which farming operations have practices similar to \nthe site that is monitored.

High TDS content of \nwest -side water is due to recharge of stream flow originating from marine sediments in the Coast \nRange, and percolation from irrigati on and rainfall events passing through soils derived from \nmarine sediments. High TDS content in the trough of the valley is the result of concentration of \nsalts due to evaporation and poor drainage (DWR, Californias Groundwater Update, 2003). In \nthe centr al and west -side portions of the valley, where the Corcoran Clay confining layer exists, \nwater quality is generally better beneath the clay than above it.\nPrimary sources of groundwater recharge in the Tulare Lake Basin Area include percolation of \nirrigati on water; seepage from rivers, streams, and irrigations canals; rainfall infiltration; and in \nthe area near Fresno, Visalia, and Bakersfield, engineered recharge primarily of runoff from the \nnearby Sierra Nevada (California Department of Water Resources, B ulletin 118, 2003 update; \nWright and others, 2004).

Approval and Review of the Management Plan\nThe following discussion describes the review and approval process for draft management plans \nsubmitted to the  Executive Officer for approval. Any proposed changes to the management plan \nmust be approved by the Executive Officer prior to implementation.\na) Water quality management plan approval   Prior to Executive Officer approval of any \nmanagement plan, the Central  Valley Water Board will post the draft management plan on \nits website for a review and comment period. Stakeholder comments will be considered by \nCentral Valley Water Board staff. Based on information provided by the  Third-Party  and \nafter consideration of  comments provided by other interested stakeholders, the Central \nValley Water Boards Executive Officer will either: (1) approve the management plan; (2) \nconditionally approve the management plan or (3) disapprove the management plan. \nReview of the managem ent plan and the associated action by the Executive Officer will be \nbased on findings as to whether the plan meets program requirements and goals and \ncontains all of the information required for a management plan.\nb)  Periodic review of water quality managemen t plans  At least once every five years, the \nCentral Valley Water Board intends to review available data to determine whether the \napproved management plan is resulting in water quality improvements. Central Valley \nWater Board staff will meet with the  Third-Party  and other interested parties to evaluate \nthe sufficiency of management plans. Based on input from all parties, the Executive \nOfficer will determine whether and how the management plan should be updated based \non new information and progress in a chieving compliance with the Orders surface or \ngroundwater receiving water limitations, as applicable (see section III of the Order). The \nExecutive Officer also may require revision of the management plan based on available \ninformation indicating that irr igated agriculture waste discharges are not in compliance  "

The \nExecutive Officer may also require revision to the management plan if available \ninformation indicates that d\negradation of surface and\/or groundwater calls for the \ninclusion of additional areas, constituents of concern(s), or improved management \npractices in the management plan. During this review, the Executive Officer will make \none of the findings described bel ow:\n1.

Management  Plan Completion\nManagement Plans can be completed in one of two ways. The first way a Management Plan \ncan be completed is if an approved source stu dy shows that irrigated agriculture is not causing \nor contributing to the water quality problem. The second way a Management Plan can be \ncompleted is if the improved management practices have resolved the water quality problem.\nThe goal of all management p lans is to identify the source(s) of COCs, track the implementation \nof effective management practices, and ultimately ensure that irrigated agriculture waste \ndischarges are meeting the surface and groundwater receiving water limitations of the Order. If \nan  approved source study shows that irrigated agriculture is not a source, then the  Third-Party  \ncan request the Executive Officer to approve completion of the associated management plan. "

If the  Third-Party  ha s chosen to rank or \nprioritize its high vulnerability areas, the initial MWISP must present an overview and justification \nfor the phased approach. Separate MWISPs showing the proposed monitoring well locations are \nrequired prior to implementation of each p hase (alternatively, the Third-Party  may prepare a \nmaster MWISP covering all of the proposed phases of well installation).  Installation of \nmonitoring wells shall not begin until the Executive Officer notifies the  Third-Party  in writing that \nthe MWISP is ac ceptable. The MWISP or an MWISP for the initial phase if the  Third-Party  has \nchosen to employ a phased approach must be submitted within 180 days after Executive Officer \napproval of the Management Practices Evaluation Workplan (see section IV of Monitoring  and \nReporting Program Order R5 -2013 -0120 -0 9 , MRP ).\nA.  Stipulations\n1.  All monitoring wells shall be constructed in a manner that maintains the integrity of the \nmonitoring well borehole and prevents the well (including the annular space outside of \nthe well  casing) from acting as a conduit for waste\/contaminant transport.  \nEach \nmonitoring well shall be appropriately designed and constructed to enable collection of \nrepresentative samples of the first encountered groundwater.

Mitigation Measure BIO -MM -1: Avoid and Minimiz e Impacts on \nSensitive Biological Resources\nImplementation of the following avoidance and minimization measures would ensure that the \nconstruction activities related to implementation of management practices and installation of \nmonitoring wells on irrigate d lands would minimize effects on sensitive vegetation communities \n(such as riparian habitat and wetlands adjacent to the construction area) and special -status \nplants and wildlife species as defined and listed in section 5.7.3 of the PEIR. In each instance  \nwhere particular management practices could result in impacts on the biological resources listed \nabove, Members should use the least impactful effective management practice to avoid such \nimpacts. Where the Orders water quality improvement goals cannot be  achieved without \nincurring potential impacts, individual farmers or  Third-Party  representatives will implement the \nfollowing measures to reduce potential impacts to less -than -significant levels.\n Where detention basins are to be abandoned, retain the basin  in its existing condition or \nensure that sensitive biological resources are not present before modification.\n Where construction in areas that may contain sensitive biological resources cannot be \navoided through the use of alternative management practices,  conduct an assessment of \nhabitat conditions and the potential for presence of sensitive vegetation communities or \nspecial -status plant and animal species prior to construction. This may include the hiring \nof a qualified biologist to identify riparian and  other sensitive vegetation communities \nand\/or habitat for special -status plant and animal species.\n Avoid and minimize disturbance of riparian and other sensitive vegetation communities.\n Avoid and minimize disturbance to areas containing special -status plan t or animal species.\n Where adverse effects on sensitive biological resources cannot be avoided, the growers \ncoverage under this Order is not authorized.

Fisheries\n1.  Mitigation Measure FISH- MM-1: Avoid and Minimize Impacts to Fish \nand Fish Habitat\nThis mitigation measure incorporates all measures identified in Mitigation Measure BIO MM 1: \nAvoid and Minimize Impacts on Sensitive Biological Resources. In each instance where \nparticular management practices could result in impacts to special -status fish  species (see \nRegulatory Classification of Special -Status Species  in section 5.8.2 of the PEIR), Members \nshould use the least impactful effective management practice to avoid such impacts. Where the \nOrders water quality improvement goals cannot be achie ved without incurring potential impacts, \nindividual farmers or  Third-Party  representatives will implement the following measures to \nreduce potential impacts to less -than -significant levels. Note that these measures may not be \nnecessary in many cases and ar e dependent on the location of construction in relation to water \nbodies containing special -status fish.\n Where construction in areas that may contain special -status fish species cannot be \navoided through the use of alternative management practices, conduct  an assessment of \nhabitat conditions and the potential for presence of special -status fish species prior to \nconstruction; this may include the hiring of a qualified fisheries biologist to determine the \npresence of special status fish species.\n Based on the s pecies present in adjacent water bodies and the likely extent of \nconstruction work that may affect fish, limit construction to periods that avoid or minimize \nimpacts to special -status fish species.\n Where construction periods cannot be altered to minimize o r avoid effects on special-\nstatus fish, the growers coverage under this Order is not authorized. The grower must \nthen apply for its own individual waste discharge requirements. Issuance of individual \nwaste discharge requirements would constitute a future  discretionary action by the Board \nsubject to additional CEQA review. "

Both of these \nprograms provide financial and technical assistance for activities that improve water quality on \nagricultural lands.\nState Water Resources Control Board\nT\nhe Division of Financial Assistance administers water quality improvement programs for the \nState Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board). The programs provide grant and \nloan funding to reduce non -point -source  pollution discharge to surface waters.\nThe Division of Financial Assistance currently administers two programs that improve water \nquality associated with agriculture \t\nthe Agricultural Drainage Management Loan Program and \nthe Agricultural Drainage Loan Progr am. Both of these programs were implemented to address \nthe management of agricultural drainage into surface water. The Agricultural Water Quality \nGrant Program provides funding to reduce or eliminate the discharge of non -point -source \npollution from agricul tural lands into surface water and groundwater. It currently is funded \nthrough bonds authorized by Proposition 84. "

In August of 2010, the Legislature removed this issue from \nthe 2010 ballot with the intent to re -introduce it in November of 2012. In July 2012, the \nLegislature approved a bill to take the measure off the 2012 ballot  and put it on the 2014 ballot. \nIf approved by the public, the new water bond would provide grant and loan funding for a wide \nrange of water -related activities, including improving agricultural water quality, conservation and \nwatershed protection, and grou ndwater protection and water quality. The majority of public \nfunds allocated by the bond would go through a rigorous competitive process to ensure dollars \nwould go to a public benefit. Additionally, this water bond is expected to leverage more than $30 \nbil lion in additional investments in local, regional, and state wide infrastructure for water supply, \nwater quality, and environmental restoration enhancements. The actual amount and timing of \nfunding availability will depend on its passage, on the issuance o f bonds and the release of \nfunds, and on the kinds of programs and projects proposed and approved for funding.\nOther Funding Programs\nO ther state and federal funding programs have been available in recent years to address \nagricultural water quality improve ments. Integrated Regional Water Management grants were \nauthorized and funded by Proposition 50 and now by Proposition 84. These are administered \njointly by the State Water Board and the California Department of Water Resources. Proposals \ncan include agric ultural water quality improvement projects.

Stakeholders indicated in these scoping meetings that they would like \nto be actively involved in developing the program.  To address this interest, the Cent ral Valley \nWater Board initiated the Long -term ILRP Stakeholder Advisory Workgroup.  The Stakeholder \nAdvisory Workgroup assisted in the development of long -term program goals and objectives and \na range of alternatives to be considered in the PEIR.\nOn 28 Jul y 2010, the Central Valley Water Board, serving as the lead agency under CEQA, \nreleas ed the Draft PEIR for the long -term ILRP.  The PEIR provides programmatic analysis of \nimpacts resulting from the implementation of six regulatory alternatives.  Five of the  alternatives \nwere developed with the Stakeholder Advisory Workgroup.  The sixth altern ative was developed \nby staff in an effort to fulfill program goals and objectives, meet applicable state policy and law, \nand minimize potentially adverse environmental imp acts and economic effects. The PEIR does \nnot analyze a preferred program alternative,  but rather equally analyzes the environmental \nimpacts of each alternative.  Further discussion regarding the PEIR alternatives is included \nbelow in the section titled  Feasibility of Alternatives Considered in the EIR.\nThe Central Valley Water Board provi ded a 60-day period for submitting written comments on \nthe Draft PEIR.  In September 2010, Central Valley Water Board staff held public workshops in \nChico, Modesto, Rancho  Cordova, and Tulare to receive input.  The Central Valley Water Board \nprovided substan tive responses to all written comments received on the Draft PEIR.

Some of the impact may be due to \nloss of structural h abitat (e.g., vegetation) whereas loss of dynamic habitat (e.g., wetted ha bitat) \ncould be an issue where tailwater augments natural flows or makes seasonal streams into \nperennial systems.

It follows that, \nbecause the costs of the Order are similar to the costs of Alternative 3, economic impacts o f the \nOrder, including those causing potential loss of Important Farmland, may be est imated using the \nanalysis of Alternative 3.\nThe PEIR describes that, under Alternative 3, 30 thousand acres of Important Farmland within \nthe entire Tulare Lake Basin poten tially would be removed from production because of the \nincreased costs.  Applying the  ratio of irrigated lands within the Tulare Lake Basin Area (est. \n2,890,000 acres) to the total irrigated lands within the Tulare Lake Basin (est. 3,450,579, Table \n3 -3, Eco nomics Report) , 2\nit is estimated that approximately 25 thousand acres of Important \nFa rmland potentially would be removed from production under the Order. Comparatively, under \nAlternative 1, described as full implementation of the previous conditional waiv er program, \napproximately 23 thousand acres of Important Farmland potentially would be  removed from \nproduction (calculated using the methodology described above).  It is unlikely that all of this \nacreage would be converted to a nonagricultural use, but it i s reasonable to assume that some \nunknown quantity would be impacted.\nBecause implement ation of the Order potentially would result in conversion of Prime Farmland, \nUnique Farmland, and Farmland of Statewide Importance to nonagricultural use, this impact is \nconsidered significant.

A statement of overridi ng consideration has been adopted, as indicated in \nthe Statement of Overriding Considerations Supporting Approval of the Order presented below.\nRatio nale for Finding\nUnlike criteria pollutant impacts, which are local and regional, climate change impacts oc cur at a \nglobal level. The relatively long lifespan and persistence of GHGs (as shown in Table 5.6 -1 of \nthe PEIR) require that climate change be cons idered a cumulative and global impact. As \ndiscussed in the PEIR, it is unlikely that any increase in global  temperature or sea level could be \nattributed to the emissions resulting from a single project.  Rather, it is more appropriate to \nconclude that, unde r the Order, GHG emissions would combine with emissions across \nCalifornia, the United States, and the globe  to cumulatively contribute to global climate change.\nGiven the magnitude of state, national, and international GHG emissions (see Tables 5.6 -2 \nthrou gh 5.6 -4 of the PEIR), climate change impacts from implementation of the Order likely would \nbe negligible.  However, scientific consensus concludes that, given the seriousness of climate \nchange, small contributions of GHGs may be cumulatively considerable.  Because it is unknown to \nwhat extent, if any, climate change would be affected by the incremental GHG emiss ions \nproduced by the Order, the impact to climate change is considered cumulatively considerable. \nMitigation Measure CC -MM -1: Apply Applicable Air Di strict Mitigation Measures to Reduce \nConstruction and Operational GHG Emissions  is within the responsibilit y and jurisdiction of \nlocal agencies, who can and should implement these measures.  Mitigation Measure CC-MM -2: \nApply Applicable California Attorney G eneral Mitigation Measures to Reduce Construction \nand Operational GHG Emissions  has been incorporated into the Order; these measures will \nresult in lower GHG emissions levels than had they not been incorporated, but they will not \ncompletely eliminate GHG e missions that could result from the Order.

Such activiti es include mining and past use of pesticides such as DDT that remain \nwithin sediments. Because many of the existing e ffects discussed in the section Existing Effects \nof Impaired Water Quality on Fish  are cumulative, it is difficult to determine the relat ive \ncontribution of irrigated lands and other sources. For example, low dissolved oxygen (DO) in the \nStockton Deepwat er Ship Channel is a result of contamination from upstream nonpoint sources \n(possibly including agricultural runoff) and discharges from th e Stockton sewage treatment plant \n(Lehman et al. 2004; Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board 2005).  App lication of \npesticides to nonagricultural lands such as urban parks and the resultant contaminant runoff \nalso cumulatively contribute to im pacts of inputs from irrigated lands.\nGiven the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys (EPAs) ongoing federal Endang ered \nSpecies Act (ESA) consultation process for pesticides as a result of recent court orders, it is \nreasonably foreseeable that further re asonable and prudent measures would be required by the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service (USFWS) that \nwould improve water quality within the Tulare Lake Basin Area.  Revision of water quality control \nplans and t otal maximum daily loads (TMDLs) also can be expected to improve water quality. \nThese and other measures, in combinat ion with the likely beneficial effects of the Order, suggest \nthat the cumulative effects of the Order are not cumulatively considerable wit h implementation of \nmitigation measures.

However, conversion has increased \nsubstantially since 2000, with an average biennial net  conversion of 114,003 acres (California \nDepartment of Conservation, Division of Land Resource Protection 2008). During the 2002 2004 \nperiod , prime farmland, unique farmland, and farmland of statewide importance was reduced by \n133,024 acres (California Depa rtment of Conservation, Division of Land Resource Protection \n2006). The trend continued during the 2004 2006 period, with a net reduction o f 125,495 acres \n(California Department of Conservation, Division of Land Resource Protection 2008).\nWhile conversion  of important farmland may not continue at the accelerated rate of the past 10 \nyears due to decreased demand for new housing, it is reasonab ly foreseeable that it will \ncontinue at a rate comparable to that seen since 1984.  Given the magnitude of important \nf armland conversion expected from implementation of the Order, the Order could result in \ncumulatively considerable impacts to agriculture re sources. Mitigation Measure AG -MM -1  has \nbeen incorporated into the Order to reduce the severity of these effects.  Whi le implementation of \nAG -MM -1 could reduce these impacts to a level that is not a cumulatively considerable \ncontribution to this statewide i mpact, such a reduction cannot be quantified.  As such, the \nOrders contribution to this impact is potentially cumulat ively considerable.

According to the California Health and Safety Code, six or more \nhuman buria ls at one location constitute a cemetery (section 8100), and the disturbance of \nNative American cemeteries is a felony (section 7 052). section 7050.5 requires that construction \nor excavation be stopped in the vicinity of the discovered human remains until  the County \nCoroner has been notified, according to PRC section 5097.98, and can determine whether the \nremains are those of Native  American origin. If the coroner determines that the remains are of \nNative American origin, the coroner must contact the Native  American Heritage Commission \n(NAHC) within 24 hours (Health and Safety Code section 7050[c]).

In August of 2010, the Legislature removed th is issue from \nthe 2010 ballot with the intent to re -int roduce it in November of 2012.  In July 2012, the \nLegislature approved a bill to take the measure off the 2012 ballot and put it on the 2014 ballot.  \nIf approved by the public, the new water bond would p rovide grant and loan funding for a wide \nrange of water -related activities, including improving agricultural water quality, conservation and \nwatershed protection, and groundwater protection and water quality.  The majority of public \nfunds allocated by the b ond would go through a rigorous competitive process to  ensure dollars \nwould go to a public benefit.  Additionally, this water bond is expected to leverage more than $30 \nbillion in additional investments in local, regional, and state wide infrastructure for  water supply, \nwater quality, and environmental restorat ion enhancements. The actual amount and timing of \nfunding availability will depend on its passage, on the issuance of bonds and the release of \nfunds, and on the kinds of programs and projects proposed  and approved for funding.\nOther Funding Programs\nOther  state and federal funding programs have been available in recent years to address \nagricultural water quality improvements. Integrated Regional Water Management grants were \nauthorized and funded by Prop osition 50 and now by Proposition 84. These are adminis tered \njointly by the State Water Board and the California Department of Water Resources. Proposals \ncan include agricultural water quality improvement projects.

Findings about t he \nfeasibility of project alternatives must be made whenever th e project within the responsibility and \njurisdiction of the lead agency will have a significant environmental effect.\nIn July 2010, the Central Valley Water Board released, for public review, t he Draft PEIR and \nDraft Technical Memorandum Concerning the Eco nomic Analysis of the Irrigated Lands \nRegulatory Program (Economics Report).  In these reports, Alternatives 1 -6 were evaluated \nconsidering environmental and economic impacts, and consistency wi th applicable state policies \nand law. 3\nIn Volume II: Appendix A \nof the PEIR, at page 136, each alternative was found to \nachieve some of the program evaluation measures but not others.  As is shown in Table 11 of \nAppendix A, no single alternative of Alterna tives 1-5 achieved complete consistency with all \nevaluation meas ures. However, after review of each of the alternatives and their common \nelements (lead entity, monitoring type), it was clear that a program that more completely \nsatisfied the evaluation meas ures could be developed by selecting from the best -performing \nel ements of the proposed alternatives.  Alternative 6, described in Appendix A of the Draft PEIR, \nwas developed by selecting these best -performing elements and became the draft staff \nrecommended  alternative.\nIn consideration of comments received concerning Al ternative 6 during the Draft PEIR review \nprocess, staff developed the recommended ILRP Framework, and prepared the  Staff Report on \nRecommended Irrigated Lands Regulatory Framework , or ILRP Framework Report (Central \nValley Water Board 2011).  The Central V alley Water Board did not adopt the Framework, but \nadvised staff to use the Framework as a starting point to support the development of ILRP \nOrders.  The Framework is based upon the sixth alter native, and is composed of elements from \nthe range of alternativ es evaluated in the PEIR.  The requirements of the Order were developed \nconsidering the Framework as a starting point per Central Valley Water Board direction (Central \nValley Water Board hearin g, June 2011). Project -level review of the requirements in the O rder 3\n \nEconomic impacts of Alternatives 1 -5 have been evaluated in the Economics Report.  Staff was \nalso able to use that analysis to esti mate costs of the recommended program alternative \n(Alternative 6), since the recommended p rogram alternative fell within the range of the five \nalternatives. This cost estimate is found in Appendix A of the PEIR. "

The Alternatives in the PEIR have been developed for implementation \nthroughout the entire Central Valley Region.  The Order is intended to serve as a single \nimplem enting order in a series of orders that will implement the long -term irrigated lands \nprogram for the entire Central Valley.  The findings below summarize why particular program \nalternatives are not being pursued.\nAlternative 1: Full Implementation of the Cu rrent Program - No Project \nUnder Alternative 1, the Central Val ley Water Board would renew the current program and \ncontinue to implement it into the future. This would be considered the  No Project Alternative \nper CEQA guidance at Title 14 California Cod e of Regulations (CCR) section 15126.6(e)(3)(A): \nWhen the proje ct is the revision of an existing land use or regulatory plan, policy or ongoing \noperation, the No Project Alternative will be the continuation of the existing plan, policy, or \noperation int o the future.  Given the reasonably foreseeable nature of the ex tension or renewal \nof the ongoing waiver, which would allow continuation of the existing program, Alternative 1 is \nbest characterized as the  No Project Alternative. This approach best serves  the purpose of \nallowing the Central Valley Water Board to compa re the impacts of revising the ILRP with those \nof continuing the existing program (14 CCR section 15126.6[e][1]).\nThird -Party  groups would continue to function as lead entities representing gr owers (owners of \nirrigated lands, nursery owners, and water dist ricts). This alternative is based on continuing \nwatershed monitoring to determine whether operations are causing water quality problems. \nWhere monitoring indicates a problem,  Third-Party  group s and growers would be required to \nimplement management practice s to address the problem and work toward compliance with \napplicable water quality standards. This alternative would not establish any new Central Valley \nWater Board requirements for discharges  to groundwater from irrigated agricultural lands.\nMonitoring un der this alternative would be the same as the watershed -based monitoring \nrequired under the current ILRP. Under this monitoring scheme,  Third-Party  groups would work \nwith the Central Valley Wa ter Board to develop monitoring plans for Central Valley Water B oard \napproval. These plans would specify monitoring parameters and site locations.\nFinding\nAn order based on Alternative 1 is not being pursued to regulate irrigated agricultural operations \nin  the Tulare Lake Basin Area instead of the Order because it woul d not substantially reduce or \neliminate any of the significant adverse effects of the Order (listed in the findings above) and it \nwould not meet all of the goals and objectives of the program  (program goals and objectives are \ndescribed in Appendix A of the  PEIR). Because Alternative 1 does not address discharges of \nwaste from agricultural lands to groundwater, it would not be fully consistent with Program Goals \n1 and 2:\nGoal 1 Restore and\/or ma intain the highest reasonable quality of State waters \nconsiderin g all the demands being placed on the water.

The \nOrder is considered superior to Alternat ive 1 for implementation in the Tulare Lake Basin Area.\nAlternative 2:  Third-Party  Lead Entity\nUnder Alternative 2, the Central Valley Water Board would develop a single mechanism or a \nse ries of regulatory mechanisms (WDRs or conditional waivers of WDRs) t o regulate waste \ndischarges from irrigated agricultural lands to ground and surface waters.\nThird -Party  groups would function as lead entities representing growers. Regulation of \ndischarg es to surface water would be similar to Alternative 1 (the current IL RP). However, this \nalternative allows for a reduction in monitoring under lower threat circumstances and where \nwatershed or area management objective plans are being developed.  This alter native also \nincludes requirements for development of groundwater qual ity management plans (GQMPs) to \nminimize discharge of waste to groundwater from irrigated lands.  Under Alternative 2, local \ngroundwater management plans or integrated regional water manag ement plans could be \nutilized, all, or in part for ILRP GQMPs, with C entral Valley Water Board approval. This \nalternative relies on coordination with the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) \nfor regulating discharges of pesticides to groundw ater.\nGrowers would be required to track implemented management pract ices and submit the \nresults to the  Third-Party  group.  Surface water monitoring under this alternative would be \nsimilar to Alternative 1.  The  Third -Party  group would report summary results to the Central \nValley Water Board.

As indicated in Appendix A, pages 96 130 of the PEIR, \nAlternative 2 would be consistent with most of the  programs goals and objectives, but would be \nonly partially consistent with the State Water Boards nonpo int source policy and the states \nantidegradation policy. Alternative 2 includes  Third-Party  \nGQMPs, but does not require \ngroundwater quality monitoring.  The Order is considered superior to Alternative 2 for \nimplementation in the Tulare Lake Basin Area. "

The alternative would establish \nrequirements for waste discharge from irrigated agricultural lands to groundwater an d surface \nwater.

Generally, this alternative requires regional management  plans to address water quality \nconcerns and regional monitoring to provide feedback on whether the practices implemented \nare working to solve identified water quality concerns.  In Tier 1 areas, i rrigated agricultural \noperations and  Third-Party  groups would  be required to describe management objectives to be \nachieved, report on management practices implemented, and make an assessment of ground \nand surface water quality every 5 years.

These significant effects include:\n Conversio n of Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, and Farmland of  Statewide Importance \nto nonagricultural use.\n Cumulative climate change.\n Cumulative vegetation and wildlife impacts.\n Cumulative conversion of Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, and Farmland of Statewide \nImportance to nonagricultural use.\n Air quality impacts.\n Traffic and transportation impacts.\nPursuant to PRC section 21081(b), specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or \nother benefits outweigh the unavoidable adverse environmental effects . The specific reasons to \nsupport this approval, given  the potential for significant unavoidable adverse impacts, are based \non the following.\nEconomic Benefits\nThe water quality improvements expected to occur in both surface and groundwater throughout \nthe  Tulare Lake Basin Area as a result of implementing the  Order is expected to create broad \neconomic benefits for residents of the state.

Pages 5 -3 5-5 of the  Draft \nTechnical Memorandum Concerning the Economic Analysis of the  Irrigated Lands Regulatory \nProgram  (ICF International  2010) identifies the potential costs of upgrading wells or treating well \nwater that is affected by nitrate contamination. The nitrate contamination is believed to be \ncoming from a variety of sources, i ncluding fertilizers used on agricultural lands.  Imple mentation  \nof the SNCP will provide immediate drinking water supplies to users of drinking water impacts \nby nitrates and will be provide a long term framework for  salt and nitrate discharges.\nConsistency with NPS Policy and State Water Board Resolution 68 -1 6 \n(Antidegradation Policy)\nWaste discharges from irrigated agricultural operations have the potential to affect surface and \ngroundwater quality.  As documented in the  Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program E xisting \nConditions Report , many state waters have been  adversely affected due in part to waste \ndischarges from irrigated agriculture.  State policy and law require that the Central Valley Water \nBoard institute requirements that will implement Water Quality  Control Plans (California Water \nCode sections 13260, 1 3269), the State Water Boards Policy for Implementation and \nEnforcement of the Nonpoint Source Pollution Control Program (NPS Policy) and applicable \nantidegradation requirements (State Water Board Reso lution 68-16). The Order is a necessary \ncomponent of t he Central Valley Water Boards efforts to be consistent with state policy and law \nthrough its regulation of discharges from irrigated agriculture.  As documented in the PEIR \nHydrology and Water Quality  analysis, implementation of a long -term ILRP, of which  the Order \nis an implementing mechanism, will improve water quality through development of farm \nmanagement practices that reduce discharges of waste to state waters.\nAfter balancing the above benefits o f the Order against its unavoidable environmental risk s, the \nspecific economic, legal, and social benefits of the proposal outweigh the unavoidable adverse \nenvironmental effects, and these adverse environmental effects are considered acceptable, \nconsistent  with the Order, Central Valley Water Board Order R5 -2 013 -0120 -0 9.

State Water Board Resolution 68 -1 6, the \nStatement of Policy with Respect to Maintaining High Quality of Waters in California \n(State Antidegradation Policy) requires a consideration, to the extent feasible, of the \ndegree to which a discharge will affect the available assimilative capacity  of a high-\nquality water relative to baseline water quality when the Central Valley Water Board is \nauthorizing degradation.\n8.  Back flow prevention devices    Back flow prevention devices are installed at the well \nor pump to prevent contamination of groundwater  or surface water when fertilizers, \npesticides, fumigants, or other chemicals are applied through an irrigation system.  Back \nflow prevention devices used to comply with this Order must be those approved by \nUSEPA, DPR, DPH, or the local public health or wat er agency. 1\n9.\n Basin Plan    The Basin Plan is the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Plan \nfor the Tulare Lake Basin. The Basin Plan describes how the quality of the surface and \ngroundwater in the Central Valley Region should be managed to ensure r easonable \nprotection of beneficial uses. The Basin Plan includes beneficial uses, water quality \nobjectives, and a program of implementation.\n10.  Central Valley SNMP (2016)    The Central Val ley S alt and Nitrate Management Plan  is \nthe basis for many components of  the Salt and Nitrate Control Program  contained in the \nTulare Lake Basin Plan  and serves as one of the reference documents for the control \nefforts.

Also, the lack of mandatory surface and  groundwater quality monitoring and the primary \nreliance on visual inspection of management practices reduces this alternatives ability to be \nconsisten t with the State Water Boards nonpoint source program.  The Order is considered \nsuperior to Alternative  3 for implementation in the Tulare Lake Basin Area.\nAlternative 4: Direct Oversight with Regional Monitoring\nUnder Alternative 4, the Central Valley Wat er Board would develop WDRs and\/or a conditional \nwaiver of WDRs for waste discharge from irrigated agric ultural lands to groundwater and \nsurface water.  As in Alternative 3, growers would apply directly to the Central Valley Water \nBoard to obtain coverage ( direct oversight). As in Alternative 3, growers would be required to \ndevelop and implement individual  FWQMPs to minimize discharge of waste to groundwater \nand surface water from irrigated agricultural lands.  Alternative 4 would also allow for formation \no f responsible legal entities that could serve a group of growers who discharge to the same \ngeneral locat ion and thus could share monitoring locations.  In such cases, the legal entity \nwould be required to assume responsibility for the waste discharges of me mber growers, to be \napproved by the Central Valley Water Board, and ultimately to be responsible for com pliance \nwith ILRP requirements.\nDischarge of waste to groundwater and surface water would be regulated using a tiered \napproach. Fields would be placed i n one of three tiers based on their threat to water quality. The \ntiers represent fields with minimal (Ti er 1), low (Tier 2), and high (Tier 3) potential threat to water \nquality. Requirements to avoid or minimize discharge of waste would be the least \ncompre hensive for Tier 1 fields and the most comprehensive for Tier 3 fields. This would allow \nfor less regula tory oversight for low -threat operations while establishing necessary requirements \nto protect water quality from higher -threat discharges.  This alternat ive relies on coordination with \nDPR for regulating discharges of pesticides to groundwater.\nFor monitoring, growers would have the option of enrolling in a  Third-Party  group regional \nmonitoring program.  In cases where responsible legal entities were formed , these entities would \nbe responsible for conducting monitoring.  All growers would be required to track  nutrient, \npesticide, and implemented management practices and submit the results to the Central Valley \nWater Board (or an approved  Third-Party  monitorin g group) annually. Other monitoring \nrequirements would depend on designation of the fields as Tier 1, Ti er 2, or Tier 3. Similar to \nAlternative 3, this alternative also includes requirements for inspection of regulated operations.\nFinding\nAn order based wh olly on Alternative 4 is not being pursued to regulate irrigated agricultural \noperations in the Tulare L ake Basin Area instead of the Order because it would not substantially \nreduce or eliminate any of the significant adverse effects of the Order (listed i n the findings \nabove) and because it would not as consistently meet the Programs goals and objectives a s \nwould the Order.  As indicated in Appendix A, pages 96 130 of the PEIR, Alternative 4 would \nmeet most of the Program goals and objectives. However, it  relies on Central Valley Water Board \nstaff interaction directly with each irrigated agricultural operati on, making it less effective at \nmeeting the coordination objectives (Objectives 4 and 5) (page 103 of Appendix A in the PEIR): "

By \ncontrast, there are a variety of technologies that have been show n to be effective in protecting \nwater quality. For example, Chapter 5 of the Irrigated Lands Program Existing Conditions \nReport 26\n(ECR) describ\nes that there are numerous management practices that Members could \nimplement to achieve water quality protection g oals. The Central Valley Water Board recognizes \nthat there is often site -specific, crop -specific, and regional variability that affects the se lection of \nappropriate management practices, as well as design constraints and pollution -control \neffectiveness of  various practices.\nGrowers need the flexibility to choose management practices that best achieve a management \nmeasures performance expectatio ns given their own unique circumstances. Management \npractices developed for agriculture are to be used as an overa ll system of measures to address \nnonpoint -source pollution sources on any given site. In most cases, not all of the practices will \nbe needed t o address the nonpoint sources at a specific site. Operations may have more than \none constituent of concern to add ress and may need to employ two or more of the practices to \naddress the multiple sources. Where more than one source exists, the application o f the \npractices should be coordinated to produce an overall system that adequately addresses all \nsources for the s ite in a cost-effective manner.\nThere is no specific set of technologies, practices, or treatment devices that can be said to \nachieve BPTC\/bes t efforts universally in the Tulare Lake Basin Area. This Order, therefore, \nestablishes a set of performance stand ards that must be achieved and an iterative planning \napproach that will lead to implementation of BPTC\/best efforts. The iterative planning ap proach \nwill be implemented as two distinct processes, 1) establishment of a baseline set of universal \nfarm water q uality management performance standards combined with upfront evaluation, \nplanning and implementation of management practices to attain those  goals, and 2) additional \nplanning and implementation measures where degradation trends are observed that threaten  to \nimpair a beneficial use or where beneficial uses are impaired (i.e., water quality objectives are \nnot being met). Taken together, the State  Water Board found that these requirements satisfied \nBPTC\/best efforts. 27\nThe Central Valley Water Board continues \nto review new data and finds \nthat this Order still satisfies BPTC\/best efforts. The planning and implementation processes that \ngrowers must f ollow on their farms should lead to the on -the -ground implementation of the \noptimal practices and control measures  to address waste discharge from irrigated agriculture.26\n \nCalifornia Regional Water Q uality Control Board, Central Valley Region, and Jones and \nStokes. 2008.

If Members, \nthrough the  Third-Party, elected to participate in in the Conservative Permitting Approach, \nMembers  would either be subject to stringent 700\/900 EC  thresholds.  Prior to authorizing \nthe degradation of a high -quality water under the Conservative Permitting Approach of the \nSalt Control Program as described in this Order, the Board must find that allowing \nd egradation by applicable Members better serves t he people of the state than their \nparticipation in the P&O Study for Phase 1 of the Salt Control Program.\nUnder the Nitrate Control Program, the Central Valley Water Board will evaluate proposed \nAlternative C ompliance Projects and Management Zone Implement ation Plans to ensure \nthat Members are developing and implementing  pollution or controls methods that are \nBPTC.  When the Central Valley Water Board reviews those proposed projects and plans, it \nwill determine  whether they are consistent wit h the States An tidegradation Policy.\nSummary\nMembers are required to implement practices to meet the above goals and periodically review the \neffectiveness of implemented practices and make improvements where  necessary. Members in \nboth high and low vulnerability areas wil l identify the practices they are implementing to achieve \nwater quality protection goals as part of farm evaluations and INMPs. Members in high \nvulnerability areas have additional requirements  associated with the SQMPs\/GQMPs; preparing \nsediment and erosion  control plans; implementing practices identified as protective through the \nMPEP studies; and reporting on their activities more frequently.\nAlso, the Order requires water quality monitoring an d assessments aimed to identify trends and \nevaluate effectivene ss of management practices, and detect exceedances of water quality \nobjectives. The process of periodic review of SQMPs\/GQMPs provides a mechanism for the \nCentral Valley Water Board to better e nsure that Members are meeting the requirements of the \nOrder, i f the Third -Party  led efforts are not effective in ensuring BPTC is achieved, where \napplicable.\nRequirements for individual farm evaluations, INMPs, sediment and erosion control plans, \nmanageme nt practices tracking, and water quality monitoring and reporti ng are designed to \nensure that degradation is minimized and that management practices are protective of water \nquality. These requirements are aimed to ensure that all irrigated lands are implem enting \nmanagement practices that minimize degradation, the effe ctiveness of such practices is \nevaluated, and feedback monitoring is conducted to ensure that degradation is limited. Even in \nlow vulnerability areas where there is no information indicating de gradation of a high quality \nwater, the farm management performa nce standards act as a preventative requirement to \nensure degradation does not occur. The information and evaluations conducted as part of the \nGQMP\/SQMP process will help inform those Members i n low vulnerability areas of the types of \npractices that meet t he performance standards. In addition, even Members in low vulnerability \ngroundwater areas must implement practices (or equivalent practices) that are identified as \nprotective through the MPEP  studies (where these practices are applicable to the Members si te \nconditions).

Because the State Water Board \nhas not distinguished between the level of  treatment and control required under BPTC and what \ncan be achie ved through best efforts, the requirements of this Order for BPTC\/best efforts apply \nequally to high quality waters and already degraded waters .\nThis Order allows degradation of existing high q uality waters. This degradation is consistent with \nmaximum bene fit to the people of the state for the following reasons:\n At a minimum, th is Order requires that irrigated agriculture achieve and maintain \ncompliance with water quality objectives and benefici al uses;\n The requirements implementing the Order will result in  use of BPTC where irrigated \nagricultural waste discharges may cause degradation of high quality waters; where \nwaters are already degraded, the requirements will result in the pollution control s that \nreflect the best efforts approach.

The Central Valley Water Board continues to review new data and concludes that \nthe  maximum benefit  analysis has not changed.\n The Salt Control Program is designed to allow short -te rm degradation while \ncomp rehensive basin -wide salinity management  strategies are developed and \nimplemented.  Authorizing such degradation would grant Members the latitude to develop \nlong -term implementation plans that are both cost -effective and that priori tize compliance \nalternati ves that will have a greater net regional and\/or sub -regional effect on salinity \nreduction. Those these measures will ultimately require that Members and other parties \nmake substantial and meaningful investments in salinity reducti on strategies and control \nmeasures, granting extended compliance timelines helps ensure that regulatory \nmeasures do not unreasonably affect the economic vitality of the Central Valleys \ncommunities by allowing productive agricultural activities  to continue  while all \nstakeholders c ollectively pursue a basin -wide salt management strategy.

Because the Nitrate Control \nProgram both addresses the economic well -being of permittees in the Central Valley and \nmandates that the  Central Valley Water  Board require that Implementation Plans ensur e \nthat all affected users  will be provided a safe drinking water supply, the degradation that \nthe  Central Valley Water  Board may authorize pursuant to the Nitrate Control Program \nand the policies designed to effectuate that program is expected to be consis tent with the \nmaximum ben efit of the people.\nThe requirements of the Order and the degradation that would be allowed are consistent with \nState Water Board Resolution 68 -16.

This Order does not require that Members implement spe cific \nwater quality manag ement practices. 33\nMany of the management practices that have water \nquality benefits can have other economic and environmental benefits (e.g., improved irrigation \ncan reduce water and energy consumption, as well as reduce runoff). Management practice \nselect ion will be based  on decisions by individual Members in consideration of the unique \nconditions of their irrigated agricultural lands; water quality concerns; and other benefits \nexpected from implementation of the practice. As such, the cost estimate is an  estimate of \npoten tial, not required costs of implementing specific practices. Any costs for water quality \nmanagement practices will be based on a market transaction between Members and those \nvendors or individuals providing services or equipment and not ba sed on an estimate of those \ncosts provided by the Central Valley Water Board. The cost estimates include estimated fees \nthe  Third -Party  may charge to prepare the required reports and conduct the required monitoring, \nas well as annual permit fees that are c harged to permitted dischargers for permit coverage. In \naccordance with the State Water Boards Fee Regulations, the current annual permit fee \ncharged to Members covered by this Order is $0.56\/acre There are a number of funding \nprograms that may be availab le to assist growers in the implementation of water quality \nmanagement practices through grants and loans (e.g., Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, State Water Board Agricultural Drainage Management Loan Program). Following is a \ndiscussion regarding  derivation of th e cost estimate for the Order.\nThis Order, which implements the Long -term ILRP within the Tulare Lake Basin Area, is based \nmainly on Alternatives 2 and 4 of the PEIR, but does include elements from Alternatives 2 -5. \nThe Order contains the  Third-Party  lead  entity structure, surface and groundwater management \nplans, and surface water quality monitoring approach similar to Alternative 2 of the PEIR; farm \nplanning, management practices tracking, nitrogen tracking, and groundwater monitoring sim ilar \nto Alternati ve 4 of the PEIR; sediment and erosion control plan (under Alternative 3, farm plan) \nrecommendation\/ certification requirements similar to Alternative 3; prioritized installation of \ngroundwater monitoring wells similar to Alternative 5;  and a prioritization system based on \nsystems described by Alternatives 2 and 4. Therefore, potential costs of these portions of the \nOrder are estimated using the costs for these components of Alternative 2 and Alternative 5 \ngiven in the Draft Technical Mem orandum Concerning the Economic Analysis of the Irrigated \nLands Regulatory Program (Economics Report). Table 2 summarizes the major regulatory \nelements of the Order and provides reference to the PEIR alternative basis. 33\n \nPer Water Code section 13360, the Central Valley Water Board may not specify the manner \nin which a Member co mplies with water quality r equirements.

As described more fully in Attachment D, this Order relies upon the PEIR  and SPEIR for \nCEQA compliance.  The re quirements of the Order include regulatory elements that are also \ncontained in the  seven alternatives analyzed in the PEIR  and SPEIR . Therefore, the actions by \nMembers to protect water quality in response to the requirements of this Order are expect ed to \nb e similar to those described for Alternatives 2 -6 of the PEIR (Alternative 1 does not include \ngroundwater protection)  and Alternative A of the SPEIR .\nThe PEIR describes that potential environmental impacts of all six alternatives are associated \nwith  implem entation of water quality management practices, construction of monitoring wells, \nand impacts to agriculture resources (e.g., loss of production of prime farmland) due to \nincreased regulatory costs. Under this Order, Members will be required to impl ement water \nquality management practices to address water quality concerns. The PEIR also describes and \nevaluates potential impacts of practices likely to be implemented to meet water quality and other \nmanagement goals on irrigated lands. These water quali ty management practices include:\n Nutrient management;\n Improved water management;\n Tailwater recovery system;\n Pressurized irrigation;\n Sediment trap, hedgerow, or buffer;\n Cover cropping or conservation tillage; and\n Wellhead protection\nThese practices are exam ples of the types of practices that would be broadly applied by \nirrigated agricultural operations throughout the Central Valley and are considered representative \nof the types of practices that would have potential environmental impacts. It is important to  note \nth at the evaluated practices are not required; operators will have the flexibility to select practices \nto meet water quality goals. This Order represents one order in a series of orders that will be \ndeveloped, based on the alternatives evaluated in th e PEIR for all irrigated agriculture within the \nCentral Valley. The requirements of this Order would lead to implementation of the above \npractices within the Tulare Lake Basin Area to a similar degree as is described for Alternatives \n2 -6 analyzed in the PE IR and  Alternative A of the SPEIR . Also, the requirements of this Order \nwill require installation of monitoring wells (with the extent depending on the adequacy of \nexisting wells for water quality monitoring).\nAs described in the PEIR for Alternatives 2 -6,  the co mbination of an operators choice of \nmanagement practice and where that practice is implemented (i.e., located within a sensitive \nresource area) may result in significant environmental impacts for the following resource areas:\nCultural resources:  Po tential  loss of resources from construction and operation of \nmanagement practices and monitoring wells.

Following the background discussi on, the Information Sheet \ndescribes how the various provisions in the WDR and MRP collectively implement Resolution \n68 -16. In summary, the requirements of Resolution 68 -16 are met through a combination  of \nupfront planning and implementation at the farm lev el; representative monitoring and \nassessments to determine whether trends in degradation are occurring; and regional planning \nand on -farm implementation when degradation trends are identified.\nInitially , all Members will need to conduct an on -farm evaluati on to determine whether their \npractices are protective of water quality and whether they are meeting the established farm \nmanagement performance standards. Through the process of becoming aware of effec tive \nmanagement practices; evaluating their practices;  and implementing improved practices; \nMembers are expected to meet the farm management performance standards and, thereby, \nachieve best practicable treatment or control (BPTC), where applicable.

The quality of some state ground and surface waters is higher \nthan established Basin Plan water quality obj ectives. For example, nutrient levels in good, or \nhig h quality  waters may be very low, or not detectable, while existing water quality standards \nfor nutrients may be much higher. In such waters, some degradation of water quality may occur \nwithout comprom ising protection of beneficial uses. State Water Board  Resolution 68 -16 \nStatement of Policy with Respect to Maintaining High Quality of Waters in California  (Resolution \n68 -16) was adopted in October of 1968 to address high quality waters in the state. Titl e 40 of \nthe Code of Federal Regulations, Section 131.1 2 Antidegradation Policy (40 CFR 131.12) was \ndeveloped in 1975 to ensure water quality necessary to protect existing uses in waters of the \nUnited States. Resolution 68 -16 applies to discharges to all hi gh quality waters of the state, \nincluding groundwater  and surface water (Water Code section 13050[e]); 40 CFR 131.12 \napplies only to surface waters.\nThe requirement to implement the Antidegradation Policy is contained in Resolution 68 -16 \n(provision 2 prese nted below) and in the Basin Plan. The Basin Plan stat es that the Central \nValley Water Board actions must conform with State Water Board plans and policies and among \nthese policies is Resolution 68 -16, which requires that:\n1.  Whenever the existing quality of  water is better than the quality established in \npolic ies as of the date on which such policies become effective, such existing \nhigh quality will be maintained until it has been demonstrated to the State that \nany change will be consistent with maximum bene fit to the people of the State, \nwill not unreasonably  affect present and anticipated beneficial use of such water \nand will not result in water quality less than that prescribed in the policies.\n2.  Any activity which produces or may produce a waste or increa sed volume or \nconcentration of waste and which dischar ges or proposes to discharge to existing \nhigh quality waters will be required to meet waste discharge requirements which \nwill result in the best practicable treatment or control of the discharge necessa ry \nto assure that (a) a pollution or nuisance will not  occur and (b) the highest water \nquality consistent with maximum benefit to the people of the State will be \nmaintained.\nFor discharges to surface waters only, the Federal Antidegradation Policy  (Section 131.12, Title \n40, CFR) requires:\n1.

In those cases where poten tial water quality impairment associated with a \nthermal discharge is involved, the antidegradation policy and implementing \nmethod shall be consistent with section 316 of the Act.\nThe State Water  Board has interpreted Resolution 68 -16 to incorporate the Fe deral \nAntidegradation Policy in situations where the policy is applicable. (SWRCB Order WQ 86 -17). \nThe application of the Federal Antidegradation Policy to nonpoint source discharges (including \nd ischarges from irrigated agriculture) is limited. 18\nAdministra\ntive Procedures Update (APU) 90 -004, Antidegradation Policy Implementation for \nNPDES Permitting, provides guidance for the Regional Water Boards in implementing \nResolution 68 -16 and 40 CFR 131.1 2, as these provisions apply to NPDES permitting. APU 90 -\n004 is not applicable in the context of this Order because nonpoint discharges from agriculture \nare exempt from NPDES permitting. 18\n \n40 CFR 131.12(a)(2) requires that the  State shall assure that there shall be achieved the \nhighest statutory and regulatory requi rements for all new and existing point sources and  all \ncost -effective and reasonable best management practices for nonp oint source control. The \nEPA Handbook, Chapter 4, clarifies this as follows:  Section 131.12(a)(2) does not mandate \nthat States establis h controls on nonpoint sources. The Act leaves it to the States to determine \nwhat, if any, controls on nonpoint sources  are needed to provide attainment of State water \nquality standards (See CWA Section 319). States may adopt enforceable requirements, or \nvoluntary programs to address nonpoint source pollution. Section 40 CFR 131.12(a)(2) does \nnot require that States adopt  or implement best management practices for nonpoint sources \nprior to allowing point source degradation of a high quality water. However,  States that have \nadopted nonpoint source controls must assure that such controls are properly implemented \nbefore author ization is granted to allow point source degradation of water quality.  Accordingly, \nin the context of nonpoint discharges, the BPTC stan dard established by state law controls. "

These terms are described be low.\nHigh Quality Waters:  Resolution 68 -16 applies whenever existing quality of water is better \nthan quality established in policies as of the date such policies become effective, 19\nand 40 CFR\n \n131.12 refers to quality of waters [that] exceed levels neces sary to support propagation of fish, \nshellfish, and wildlife and recreation. Such waters are high quality waters under the state and \nfederal antidegradation policies.  In other words, high qu ality waters are waters with a \nbackground quality of better qua lity than that necessary to protect beneficial uses. 20\nThe Water \nCode directs the State Water Board and the Regional Water Boards to establish water quality \nobjectives for the reasonable protec tion of beneficial uses. Therefore, where water bodies \ncontain l evels of water quality constituents or characteristics that are better than the established \nwater quality objectives, such waters are considered high quality waters.\nBoth state and federal gui dance indicates that the definition of high quality waters is es tablished \nby constituent or parameter [State Water Board Order WQ 91 -10; USEPA Water Quality \nHandbook, Chapter 4 Antidegradation (40 CFR 131.12) ( EPA Handbook)]. Waters can be of \nhigh qualit y for some constituents or beneficial uses but not for others.  W ith respect to degraded \ngroundwater, a portion of the aquifer may be degraded with waste while another portion of the \nsame aquifer may not be degraded with waste. The portion not degraded is h igh quality water \nwithin the meaning of Resolution 68 -16. See St ate Water Board Order WQ 91 -10.\nIn order to determine whether a water body is a high quality water with regard to a given \nconstituent, the background quality of the water body unaffected by th e discharge must be \ncompared to the water quality objectives. If  the quality of a water body has declined since the \nadoption of the relevant policies and that subsequent lowering was not a result of regulatory \naction consistent with the state antidegradati on policy, a baseline representing the historically \nhigher water  quality may be an appropriate representation of background. 21\nHowever, if the \ndecline in water quality was permitted consistent with state and federal antidegradation policies, \nthe most recen t water quality resulting from permitted action constitutes the r elevant baseline for \ndetermination of whether the water body is high quality. See, e.g., SWRCB Order WQ 2009 -\n0007 at 12. Additionally, if water quality conditions have improved historically,  the current higher \nwater quality would again be the point of comp arison for determining the status of the water \nbody as a high quality water.\nBest Practicable Treatment or Control:  Resolution 68 -16 requires that, where degradation of \nhigh quality waters is  permitted, best practicable treatment or control (BPTC) limits t he amount 19\n \nSuch policies would include policies such as State Water Board Resolution 88 -63, Sources of \nDrinking Water Policy, establishing beneficial uses, and water quality control plans. 20\n \nUSEPA Water Quality Handbook, Chap ter 4 Antidegradation (40 CFR 131.12), defines  high \nquality waters  as  those whose quality exceeds that necessary to protect the section 101(a)(2) \ngoals of the Act [Clean Water Act], regardless of use designation. 21\n \nThe state antidegradation policy was  adopted in 1968, therefore water quality as far back as \n1968 may be relevant to an antidegradation analysis. For purpos es of application of the federal \nantidegration policy only, the relevant year would be 1975. "

Neither the Water Code nor Resolution 68\n-16 defines the term \nbest practicable treatment or control.\nDespite the lack of a BPTC definition, certain S tate Water Board water quality orders and other \ndocuments provide  direction on the interpretation of BPTC. The State Water Board has stated: \none factor to be considered in determining BPTC would be the water quality achieved by other \nsimilarly situated di schargers, and the methods used to achieve that water quality.  ( See Order \nWQ 2000 -07, at pp. 10- 11). In a Questions and Answers  document for Resolution 68 -16 (the \nQuestions and Answers Document), BPTC is interpreted to additionally include a comparison  of \nthe proposed method to existing proven technology; evaluation  of performance data (through \ntreatability studies); comparison of alternative methods of treatment or control; and\/or \nconsideration of methods currently used by the discharger or similarly si tuated dischargers. 22\nThe costs of the treatment or control should\n also be considered. Many of the above \nconsiderations are made under the  best efforts approach described later in this section. In fact, \nthe State Water Board has not distinguished between  the level of treatment and control required \nunder BPTC and what c an be achieved through  best efforts.\nThe Regional Water Board may not  specify the design, location, type of construction, or \nparticular manner in which compliance may be had with [a] requ irement, order, or decree \n(Water Code 13360). However, the Region al Water Board still must require the discharger to \ndemonstrate that the proposed manner of compliance constitutes BPTC (SWRCB Order WQ \n2000 -7). The requirement of BPTC is discussed in great er detail below.\nMaximum Benefit to People of the State:  Resolutio n 68-16 requires that where degradation of \nwater quality is permitted, such degradation must be consistent with the  maximum benefit to \npeople of the state.  Only after  intergovernmental co ordination and public participation  and a \ndetermination that  allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate important \neconomic or social development in the area in which the waters are located  does 40 CFR \n131.12 allow for degradation.\nAs described in the Question and Answers Document, factors considered in d etermining \nwhether degradation of water quality is consistent with maximum benefit to people of the State \ninclude economic and social costs, tangible and intangible, of the proposed discharg e, as well \nas the environmental aspects of the proposed discharge,  including benefits to be achieved by \nenhanced pollution controls. Closely related to the BPTC requirement, consideration must be \ngiven to alternative treatment and control methods and wheth er lower water quality can be \nabated or avoided through reasonable  means, and the implementation of feasible alternative \ntreatment or control methods should be considered.\nUSEPA guidance clarifies that the federal antidegradation provision  is not a no growth rule \nand was never designed or intended to be such. It is a  policy that allows public decisions to be \nmade on important environmental actions. Where the state intends  to provide for development, \nit may decide under this section, after satisfying the requirements for intergovernmental \ncoordination and public partici pation, that some lowering of water quality in \"high quality 22\n \nSee  Questions and Answers, State Water Res ources Control Board, Resolution 68-16  \n(February 16, 1995).

However, as a floor, any \ndegradation permitted under t he antidegradation policies must not cause an exceedance of \nwater quality objectives or a pollution or nuisanc e. Furthermore, the NPS Policy establishes a \nfloor for all water bodies in that implementation programs must address NPS pollution in a \nmanner tha t achieves and maintains water quality objectives and beneficial uses.\nWaters that are Not High Quality: The  Best Efforts Approach: Where a water body is not \nhigh quality and the antidegradation policies are accordingly not triggered, the Central Valley \nWater Board should, under State Water Board precedent, set limitations more stringent than the \nobjectives set  forth in the Basin Plan. The State Water Board has directed that,  where the \nconstituent in a groundwater basin is already at or exceeding the wat er quality objective, t he \nRegional Water Board should set limitations more stringent than the Basin Plan obje ctives if it \ncan be shown that those limitations can be met using best efforts.  SWRCB Order WQ 81 -5; \nsee also SWRCB Orders Nos. WQ 79 -14, WQ 82 -5, WQ 2000 -07. Finally, the NPS Policy \nestablishes standards for management practices.\nThe  best efforts  approach involves the Regional Water Board establishing limitations expected \nto be achieved using reasonable control measures. Factors which should b e analyzed under the \nbest efforts  approach include the effluent quality achieved by other similarly situated  \ndischargers, the good faith efforts of the discharger to limit the discharge of the constituent, and \nthe measures necessary to achieve compliance . SWRCB Order WQ 81-5, at p. 7.  The State \nWater Board has applied the best efforts factors in interpreting B PTC. (See SWRCB Order \nNos. WQ 79 -14, and WQ 2000 -07).\nIn summary, the  Board may set discharge limitations more stringent than water quality \nobject ives even outside the context of the antidegradation policies. The  best efforts approach \nmust be taken where  a water body is not  high quality and the antidegradation policies are \naccordingly not triggered.\nApplication of Resolution 68 -16 Requirements t o this Order\nThe determination of a high quality water within the meaning of the antidegradation policies is \nw ater body and constituent -specific. Very little guidance has been provided in state or federal \nlaw with respect to applying the antidegradation po licy to a program or general permit where \nmultiple water bodies are affected by various discharges, some of wh ich may be high quality \nwaters and some of which may, by contrast, have constituents at levels that already exceed \nwater quality objectives.

Those same data collection eff orts also indicate that other surface water bodies \nwithin the watershed meet objectives for particular constituents and would be considered  high \nquality waters  with respect to those constituents.\nSimilarly, as described above in the  Groundwater Quality Monitoring section, large areas \nwithin the Tulare Lake Basin Area contain groundwater wells which contain maximum nitrate \nlevels above applicab le water quality objectives. The groundwater represented by these wells \nmay not be considered  high quality wit h respect to nitrates. 25\nHowever, it is unknown when the \ndegradation occurred. Available data show that currently existing quality of certain wa ter bodies \nis better than the water quality objectives; for example, deeper groundwaters, represented by \nmunicipa l supply wells, are generally high quality with respect to pesticides and nitrates. \nDegradation of such waters can be permitted only consistent  with the state and federal \nantidegradation policies.\nGiven the significant variation in conditions over the broa d areas covered by this Order, any \napplication of the antidegradation requirements must account for the fact that at least some of \nthe waters i nto which agricultural discharges will occur are high quality waters (for some \nconstituents). Further, the Order  provisions should also account for the fact that even where a \nwater body is not high quality (such that discharge into that water body is not s ubject to the \nantidegradation policy), the Central Valley Water Board should, under State Water Board  23\n \nState Water Resources Control Board, WQO 2018 -0002 held t hat in a general order, a \ngeneral review and analysis of readily available data is sufficient to determine the baseline \nwater quality. (W QO 2018-0002, p. 78.) 24\n \nIrrigated lands discharges have been regulated under a conditional waiver since 1982, but \ncompr ehensive data as to trends under the waiver are not available. 25\n \nAs mentioned above, water quality dating as far back as 1968 may be need ed to determine \nwhether such waters are considered  high quality under Resolution 68 -16.

The selection of appropriate management pra ctices \nmust include analysis of site -specific conditions, waste types, discharge mechanisms, \nand crop types. Considering this, as well as the  Water Code 13360 mandate that the \nRegional Water Board not specify the manner of compliance with its requirements,  \nselection must be done at the farm level. Following are the performance standards that \nall Members must achieve:\na) minimize waste  discharge offsite in surface water;\nb)  minimize or eliminate the discharge of sediment above background levels;\nc)  minimize percolati on of waste to groundwater;\nd)  minimize excess nutrient application relative to crop consumption;\ne)  prevent pollution and nuisance;\nf)   ac hieve and maintain water quality objectives and beneficial uses, and\ng)  protect wellheads from surface water intrusion.\nBPTC is no t defined in Resolution 68 -16. However, the State Water Board describes in \nits 1995 Questions and Answers, Resolution 68 -16:  To  evaluate the best practicable \ntreatment or control method, the discharger should compare the proposed method to \nexisting proven  technology; evaluate performance data, e.g., through treatability studies; \ncompare alternative methods of treatment or control;  and\/or consider the method \ncurrently used by the discharger or similarly situated dischargers.  Available state and \nfederal gui dance on management practices may serve as a measure of the types of \nwater quality management goals for irrigated agriculture rec ommended throughout the \nstate and country (e.g., water quality management goals for similarly situated \ndischargers). This will  provide a measure of whether implementation of the above \nperformance standards will lead to implementation of BPTC\/best efforts.\nAs part of Californias Nonpoint Source Pollution Control Program, the State Water \nBoard, California Coastal Commission, and ot her state agencies have identified \nseven management measures to address agricultural nonpoint sources of pollution \nthat affect st ate waters (Californias Management Measures for Polluted Runoff , \nreferred to below as  Agriculture Management Measures ). 28\nThe\n agricultural \nmanagement measures include practices and plans installed under various NPS \nprograms in California, including systems of practices commonly used and \nrecommended by the USDA as components of resource management systems, \nwater quality manag ement plans, and agricultural waste management systems. 28\n \nCalifornias Management Measures for Polluted Runoff  <\nwww.waterboards.ca.gov\/water_issues\/programs\/nps\/docs\/cammpr\/info.pdf > "

It contains \ninformation on the best available, economically achievable means of reducing \npollution of surface and ground water from agriculture.\nBoth of the above gu idance documents describe a series of management measures, \nsimilar to the farm management performance standards and related requirements of the \nOrder. The agricultural management measures described in the state and USEPA \nreference documents generally inclu de: 1) erosion and sediment control, 2) facility \nwastewater and runoff from confined animal facilities, 3) nutrient management, 4) \npesticide management, 5) grazing management, 6) irrigation water management, and 7) \neducation and outreach. A comparison of t he recommendations with the Orders \nrequirements is provided below.\nManagement measure 1, erosion and sediment control.  Practices implemented to \nminimize waste discharge offsite and erosion (performance standards a and b) are \nconsistent with this managemen t measure to achieve erosion and sediment control. The \nOrder requires that all Members implement sediment discharge and erosion prevention \npractices to minimize or eliminate the discharge of sediment above background levels. \nThose Members that have the potentia l to cause erosion and discharge sediment that may \ndegrade surface waters must develop a farm -specific sediment and erosion control plan.\nManagement measure 2 is not applicable , as this Order does not address waste \ndischarges from confined animal faci lities\nManagement measure 3, nutrient management . As described in the States Agricultural \nManagement Measures document,  this measure addresses the development and \nimplementation of comprehensive nutrient management plans for areas where nutrient \nrunoff i s a problem affecting coastal waters and\/or water bodies listed as impaired by \nnutrients.  Nutrient management practices implemented to meet performance standards \nare consistent with this measure. The Order also requires irrigation and nitrogen \nmanagement  plans (INMP) to be developed by Members within both high vulnerability \nand low vulnerability groundwater areas. INMPs require Members to document how their \nfertilizer use management practices meet performance standards. This order also \nrequires the use of  multi-year A\/R ratio, which will lead to more effective management \npractices over time. Finally, where nutrients are causing exceedances of water quality \nobjectives in surface waters, this Order would require development of a detailed SQMP \nwhich would addr ess sources of nutrients and require implementation of practices to \nmanage nutrients. Collectively, these requirements work together in a manner consistent \nwith management measure 3. 29\n \nUSEPAs National  Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from  Agriculture (EPA 841\n-B -03 -004, July 2003;)  <\nwater.epa.gov\/polwaste\/nps\/agriculture\/agmm_index.cfm > "

As described in the States Agricultural \nManagement Measures document, this measure  is intended to reduce contamination of \nsurface water and groundwater from pesticides.  Performance standards a, c, e, f, and g \nare consistent with this management measure, requiring Members to impleme nt practices \nthat minimize waste discharge to surface and groundwater (such as pesticides), prevent \npollution and nuisance, achieve and maintain water quality objectives, and implement \nwellhead protection measures.\nManagement measure 5, grazing management.  As d escribed in the state Agriculture \nManagement Measures document, this measure is  intended to protect sensitive areas \n(including stream banks, lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and riparian zones) by reducing \ndirect loadings of animal wastes and sediment.  W hile  none of the Orders farm \nmanagement goals directly address grazing management, performance standards a, b, \ne and f, when considered by an irrigated pasture operation would lead to the same \nmanagement practices, e.g., preventing erosion, discharge of s ediment, and ensuring \nthat animal waste loadings do not cause pollution or nuisance, and achieve water \nquality objectives. The Order also requires that all Members implement sediment \ndischarge and erosion prevention practices to minimize or eliminate the d ischarge of \nsediment above background levels.\nManagement measure 6, irrigation water management.  As described in the state \nAgricultural Management Measures document, this measure  promotes effective irrigation \nwhile reducing pollutant delivery to surface and gr ound waters. Performance standards a \nand c, requiring Members to minimize waste discharge  to surface and groundwater will \nlead to practices that will also achieve this management measure. For example, a Member \nmay choose to implement efficient irrigation  management programs (e.g., timing, \nuniformity testing), technologies (e.g., spray, drip irr igation, tailwater return), or other \nmethods to minimize discharge of waste to surface water and percolation to groundwater.\nManagement measure 7, education and outr each. The Order requires that  Third-Party  \ngroups conduct education and outreach activities  to inform Members of program \nrequirements and water quality problems.\nImplementation of practices to achieve the Orders water quality requirements described \nabove is consistent with the state and federal guidance for management measures. \nBecause these mea sures are recommended for similarly situated dischargers (e.g., \nagriculture), compliance with the requirements of the Order will lead to implementation of \nBPTC\/best  efforts by all Members.\n2.  Additional Planning and Implementation Measures (SQMP\/GQMPs)\nThi s Order requires development of water quality management plans (surface or \ngroundwater) where degradation trends are observed that threaten to impair a beneficial \nus e or where beneficial uses are impaired (i.e., water quality objectives are not being \nmet).  SQMPs\/GQMPs include requirements to investigate sources, develop strategies to \nimplement practices to ensure waste discharges are meeting the Orders surface and \ngro undwater receiving water limitations, and develop a monitoring strategy to provide  "

In addition, the SQMPs\/GQMPs \nmust include actions to  Identify, validate, and implement management practices to \nreduce  loading of COCs [constituents of concern] to surface water or groundwater, as \napplicable,  thereby improving water quality  (see Appendix MRP -1). Under these plans, \nadditional management practices will be implemented in an iterative manner, to ensure \nthat  the management practices represent BPTC\/best efforts and that degradation does \nnot threaten  beneficial uses. The SQMPs\/GQMPs need to meet the performance \nstandards set forth in this Order. The SQMPs\/GQMPs are also reviewed periodically to \ndetermine whether  adequate progress is being made to address the degradation trend or \nimpairment. If adequat e progress is not being made, then the Executive Officer can \nrequire field monitoring studies, on -site verification of implementation of practices, or the \nB oard may  revoke the coverage under this Order and regulate the discharger through an \nindividual WDR.\nIn cases where effectiveness of practices in protecting water quality is not known, the \ndata and information gathered through the SQMP\/GQMP and MPEP processes will  result \nin the identification of management practices that meet the performance standards an d \nrepresent BPTC\/best efforts. Since the performance standards also apply to low \nvulnerability areas with high quality waters, those data and information will help i nform \nthe Members and Central Valley Water Board of the types of practices that meet \nperfor mance standard requirements. \nIt is also important to note that in some cases, other agencies may establish performance \nstandards that are equivalent to BPTC and may  be relied upon as part of a SQMP or \nGQMP. For example, the Department of Pesticide Regulat ion (DPR) has established \nGroundwater Protection Areas within the Tulare Lake Basin Area that require growers to \nimplement specific groundwater quality protection re quirements for certain pesticides. \nThe practices required under DPRs Groundwater Protectio n Program are considered \nBPTC for those pesticides requiring permits in groundwater protection areas, since the \npractices are designed to prevent those pesticides fr om reaching groundwater and they \napply uniformly to similarly situated dischargers in the a rea.\nThe State Water Board indicates in its Questions and Answers, Resolution 68 -16:  To \nevaluate the best practicable treatment or control method, the discharger \nsh ouldevaluate performance data, e.g., through treatability studies ... Water quality \nmanage ment plans, referred to as SQMPs\/GQMPs above, institute an iterative process \nwhereby the effectiveness of any set of practices in minimizing degradation will be \nperi odically reevaluated as necessary and\/or as more recent and detailed water quality \ndata bec ome available. This process of reviewing data and instituting additional practices \nwhere necessary will continue to assure that BPTC\/best efforts are implemented and  will \nfacilitate the collection of information necessary to demonstrate the performance of  the \npractices. This iterative process will also ensure that the highest water quality consistent \nwith maximum benefit to the people of the state will be maintained.\nResolution 68 -16 does not require Members to use technology that is better than \nnecessary t o prevent degradation. As such, the Central Valley Water Board presumes \nthat the performance standards required by this Order are sufficiently achieving BPTC  "

Further, since BPTC determinations are informed by the \nconsideration of costs, it is important that discharges in these areas not be subject to the \nmore stri ngent and expensive requirements associated with SQMPs\/GQMPs. Therefore, \nthough Members in  low vulnerability areas must still meet the farm management \nperformance standards described above, they do not need to incur additional costs \nassociated with SQMPs \/GQMPs where there is no evidence of their contributing to \ndegradation of high quality wate rs.\n3.  Management Practices Evaluation Program (MPEP) and Other Reporting and Planning \nRequirements\nIn addition to the SQMPs\/GQMPs, the Order includes a comprehensiv e suite of reporting \nrequirements that should provide the Central Valley Water Board with t he information it \nneeds to determine whether the necessary actions are being taken to achieve BPTC and \nprotect water quality, where applicable. In high vulnerability  groundwater areas, the  Third-\nParty  must develop and implement a Management Practices Evalu ation Program \n(MPEP). The MPEP will include evaluation studies of management practices to determine \nwhether those practices are protective of groundwater quality (e. g., that will not cause or \ncontribute to exceedances of water quality objectives) for ident ified constituents of \nconcern under a variety of site conditions. If the management practices are not protective, \nnew practices must be developed, implemented, and e valuated. Any management \npractices that are identified as being protective of water quality , or those that are equally \neffective, must be implemented by Members who farm under similar conditions (e.g., crop \ntype, soil conditions) (see provision IV.B.21 of  the Order).\nFarm management performance standards are applicable to both high and low \nvulne rability areas. The major difference in high and low vulnerability areas is the priority \nfor action. High vulnerability areas may contain both high and low quality w aters with \nrespect to constituents discharged by irrigated agriculture, and the MPEP and ot her \nreporting, planning, and implementation requirements will determine and require actions \nto achieve BPTC and best efforts for high and low quality waters, respect ively. Because \nlow vulnerability areas present less of a threat of degradation or pollution , additional time \nis provided, or a lower level of review and certification is required, for some of the \nplanning and reporting requirements. Also, while an MPEP is  not required for the low \nvulnerability areas, the actions required by the MPEP must be impl emented as applicable \nby Members in both high and low vulnerability areas, and will therefore result in the \nimplementation of BPTC and best efforts in high and low v ulnerability areas, and will \ninform evaluation of compliance with performance standards in  all areas. The Order \nrequires implementation of actions that achieve BPTC and best efforts for both high and \nlow quality waters, respectively.\nTo determine whether a  degradation trend is occurring, the Order requires surface water \nmonitoring at sites desig nated by the Surface Water Monitoring Plan. The data gathered \nfrom the surface water monitoring effort will allow the Central Valley Water Board to \ndetermine whether  there is a trend in degradation of water quality related to discharges \nfrom irrigated agri culture. For groundwater, a trend monitoring program is required in both  "

The trend monitoring for the low \nvulnera bility areas is required to help the Central Valley Water Board determine whether \nany trend in degradation of groundwater quality is occurring. For pesticides in \ngroundwater, the Central Valley Water Board wi ll initially rely on the information gathered \nth rough the Department of Pesticide Regulations (DPR) monitoring efforts to determine \nwhether any degradation related to pesticides is occurring. If the available groundwater \nquality data (e.g., nitrates, pest icides) in a low vulnerability area suggests tha t \ndegradation is occurring that could threaten to impair beneficial uses, then the area would \nbe re -designated as a high vulnerability area.\nThe  Third -Party  is required to prepare a Groundwater Quality Assess ment Report (GAR) \nand update that report every f ive years. The GAR will include an identification of high \nvulnerability and low vulnerability areas, including identification of constituents that could \ncause degradation. The initial submittal of the GAR wil l include a compilation of water \nquality data, w hich the Central Valley Water Board and  Third-Party  will use to evaluate \ntrends. The periodic updates to the GAR will require the consideration of data collected \nby the  Third-Party , as well as other organizat ions, and will also allow the Central Valley \nWat er Board and  Third-Party  to evaluate trends. The GAR will provide a reporting vehicle \nfor the Central Valley Water Board to periodically evaluate water quality trends to \ndetermine whether degradation is occur ring. If the degradation triggers the requiremen t \nfor a GQMP, then the area in which the GQMP is required would be considered  high \nvulnerability  and all of the requirements associated with a high vulnerability area would \napply to those Members.\nAll Membe rs will also need to report on their management  practices through the farm \nevaluation process. In addition, all members will need to prepare INMPs prepared in \naccordance with the INMP templates approved by the Executive Officer. The plans require \nMembers t o report their irrigation and nitrogen applicati on practices and to document how \ntheir fertilizer use management practices minimize excess nutrient application relative to \ncrop consumption. The INMP will also include the multi -year A\/R ratio and A -R differ ence. \nThe planning requirements are phased accor ding to threat level such that members in low \nvulnerability areas have more time to complete their plans than those in high vulnerability \nareas. Through the farm evaluation, the Member must identify on -farm m anagement \npractices implemented to achieve the O rders farm management performance standards. \nINMPs and INMP summary reports provide indicators as to whether the Member is \nmeeting the performance standard to minimize excess nutrient application relative to  crop \nneed for nitrogen. The MPEP study process  would be used to determine whether the \nnitrogen consumption ratio meets the performance standard of the Order.\n4.  Participation in the Salt  and Nitrate Control Program\nThe Salt  and Nitrate  Control Program est ablishes a long-term framework for addressing \nle gacy and ongoing salt and nitrate accumulation.  Under the Salt Control Program, both \ncompliance pathways require the implementation of BPTC.  If Members, through the  Third-\nParty , elected to participate in the  Alternative Salinity Permitting Approach, p\narticipation in \nthe Prioritization and Optimization Study (P&O Study) and implementation of reasonable, \nfeasible, and practicable efforts to control levels of salt in discharges is considered to be  "

The Order requires that discharges of \nwaste from irrigated lands to surface water and groundwater do not  cause or contribute to \nan exceedance of applicable water quality objectives. SQMPs and GQMPs are required \nin areas where  water quality objectives are not being met  where irrigated lands are a \npotential source of the concern, and in areas where irrigated a griculture may be causing \nor contributing to a trend of degradation that may threaten applicable beneficial uses. \nGQMPs  are also required in high vulnerability groundwater areas. Under these plans, \nsources of waste must be estimated along with background w ater quality to determine \nwhat options exist for reducing waste discharge to ensure that irrigated lands are not \ncausing  or contributing to the water quality problem. The SQMPs and GQMPs must be \ndesigned to ensure that waste discharges from irrigated lands  do not cause or contribute \nto an exceedance of a water quality objective and meet other applicable requirements of \nthe  Order, including, but limited to, section III.\nd)  Economic considerations\nThe PEIR was supported by the Draft Technical Memorandum Concerni ng the Economic \nAnalysis of the Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program (Economics Report). An extensive \neconomic analysis wa s presented in this report to estimate the cost and broader economic \nimpact on irrigated agricultural operations associated with the fiv e alternatives for the \nirrigated lands program, including the lands regulated by this Order. Central Valley Water \nBoard  Staff was also able to use that analysis to estimate costs of a sixth alternative, since \nthe sixth alternative fell within the range of  the five alternatives. This cost estimate is found \nin Appendix A of the PEIR. This Order is based on the alternatives ev aluated in the PEIR, \nwhich is part of the administrative record. Therefore, potential economic considerations \nrelated to the Order have  been considered as part of the overall economic analysis for \nimplementation of the long -term irrigated lands regulatory  program. This Order is a single \naction in a series of actions to implement the ILRP in the Central Valley region. Because \nthe Order has  been developed from the alternatives evaluated in the PEIR, economic \neffects will be within the range of those described  for the alternatives.\nOne measure considered in the PEIR is the potential loss of Important Farmland 39\ndue to \nincreased regulatory cost s. This information has been used in the context of this Order to \nestimate potential loss of Important Farmland within th e Tulare Lake Basin Area. It is \nestimated that approximately 22,887 thousand acres of Important Farmland within the \nTulare Lake Basin A rea potentially would be removed from production under full \nimplementation of the previous conditional waiver program (Co nditional Waiver Order R5-\n2006 -0053); it is estimated that an additional 838 acres of Important Farmland may be \nremoved from production  due to increased regulatory costs of this Order (total of \napproximately 23,726 thousand acres, as described in Attachmen t D of this Order). As \ndescribed in the Economics Report, most of the estimated losses would be to lower value \ncrop land, such as irrig ated pasture and forage crops.39\n \nImportant  Farmland is defined in the PEIR as farmland identified a s prime, unique, or of \nstatewide importance by the California Department of Conservation, Farmland Mapping and \nMonitoring Program.

The Order is not intended to establish requirements for any facilities \nt hat accept wastewater from residences or stormwater runoff from residential areas. This \nOrder will not affect the develop ment of housing within the region.\nf)   The need to develop and use recycled water\nThis Order does not establish any requirements for the us e or purveyance of recycled \nwastewater. Where an agricultural operation may have access to recycled wastewater of \nappropr iate quality for application to fields, the operation would need to obtain \nappropriate waste discharge requirements from the Central Va lley Water Board prior to \ninitiating use. This need to obtain additional waste discharge requirements in order to \nrecycle  wastewater on agricultural fields instead of providing requirements under this \nOrder may complicate potential use of recycled wastewat er on agricultural fields. \nHowever, the location of agricultural fields in rural areas generally limits access to large \nvolumes of appropriately treated recycled wastewater. As such, it is not anticipated that \nthere is a need to develop general waste disch arge requirements for application of \nrecycled wastewater on agricultural fields in the Tulare Lake Basin Area. "

This MRP includes requirements \nfor a  Third-Party  representative entity assisting indiv idual irrigated lands operators or owners \nthat are members of the  Third-Party  (Members), as well as requirements for individual Members \nsubject to and enrolled under Waste Discharge Requirements General Order for Growers within \nthe Tulare Lake Basin Area that are Members of the  Third-Party  Group, Order R5 -2013 -0120 -0 9 \n(hereafter referred to as the  Order). This MRP applies to each  Third-Party  issued an NOA by \nthe Executive Officer.  The requirements of this MRP are necessary to monitor Member \ncompliance wit h the provisions of the Order and determine whether state waters receiving \ndischarges from Members are meeting water quality objectives.  Additional discussion and \nrationale for this MRPs requirements are provided in Attachment A of the Order.\nThis MRP est ablishes specific surface and groundwater monitoring, reporting, and electronic \ndata deliverable requirements for the  Third-Party . Due to the nature of irrigated agricultural \noperations, monitoring requirements for surface waters and groundwater will be pe riodically \nreassessed to determine if changes should be made to better represent irrigated agriculture \ndischarges to state waters.  The monitoring schedule will also be reassessed so that constituents \nare monitored during application and\/or release timefram es when constituents of concern are \nmost likely to affect water quality.  The  Third -Party  shall not implement any changes to this MRP \nunless the Central Valley Water Board or the Executive Officer issues a revised MRP.\nII.   General Provisions\nThis Monitoring  and Reporting Program (MRP) conforms to the goals of the Non -point Source \n(NPS) Program as outlined in  The Plan for Californias Nonpoint Source Pollution (NSP) \nProgram  by:\n tracking, monitoring, assessing and reporting program activities;\n ensuring consistent and accurate reporting of monitoring activities;\n targeting NPS Program activities at the watershed level;\n coordinating with public and private partners; and\n tracking implementation of management practices to improve water quality and protect \nexisting beneficial uses.\nMonitoring data collected to meet the requirements of the Order must be collected and analyzed \nin a manner that assures the quality of the data.  \nThe  Third -Par ty must follow sampling and \nanalytical procedures as specified in Attachment C, Order No. R5 -2008 -0005, Coalition Group  "

The  Third -Party  must submit \nspecific Member information collected as part of the Order and this MRP when requested by the \nExecutive Officer or as  specified in the Order.\nThis MRP Order becomes effective on 19 September 2013.  The Central Valley Water Board \nExecutive Officer may revise this MRP as necessary. Upon the Executive Officer issuing the \nNotice of Applicability to the  Third-Party , the Third -P arty , on behalf of the individual Members, \nshall implement the following monitoring and reporting.\nIII.  Surface Water Quality Monitoring Requirements\nThe surface water quality monitoring and reporting requirements in the MRP have been \ndeveloped in consider ation of the critical questions identified in the Information Sheet \n(Attachment A).  The  Third -Party  must collect sufficient data to describe irrigated agricultures \nimpacts on surface water quality and to determine whether existing or newly implemented \nman agement practices comply with the surface water receiving water limitations of the Order. \nSurface water monitoring shall include a comprehensive suite of constituents (also referred to as \nparameters ) monitored periodically in a manner that allows for an  evaluation of the condition of \na water body and determination of whether irrigated agriculture operations in the Tulare Lake \nBasin Area are causing or contributing to any surface water quality problems.\nA.  Surface Water Monitoring Plan\nThe  Third -Party  grou p shall design a scientifically and technically justifiable Surface Water \nMonitoring Plan sufficient to characterize water quality for all waters of the state within the  Third-\nParty  groups boundaries.  Two (2) months after receiving a NOA from the Central  Valley Water \nBoard, the  Third-Party  will provide a proposed outline for the Surface Water Monitoring Plan to \nthe Executive Officer, that describes the Monitoring Plan and data sources and references that \nwill be considered in developing the Surface Water M onitoring Plan. The completed plan is due \n180 days after receiving an NOA (see section VIII. G of Waste Discharge Requirements Order \nR5 -2013 -0120 -0 9).  Monitoring proposed within the Surface Water Monitoring Plan must provide \nsufficient data to describe irri gated agricultures impacts on surface water quality and to \ndetermine whether existing or newly implemented management practices comply with the \nSurface Water Limitations of the Order.  If the Executive Officer disapproves the Surface Water \nMonitoring Plan  in whole or part, the Executive Officer may require revisions to the Surface \nWater Monitoring Plan, or issue a Surface Water Monitoring Plan to address the surface water  1\n \nCentral Valley Water Board staff  will make proposed revisions of the QAPP Guidelines  \navailable  for public review and comment prior to Executive Officer consideration for approval.

Groundwater Quality Monitoring and Management \nPractice Assessment, and E valuation Requirements\nThe groundwater quality monitoring, assessment, and evaluation requirements in this MRP have \nbeen developed in consideration of the critical questions developed by the Groundwater \nMonitoring Advisory Workgroup (questions are presente d in the Information Sheet, Attachment \nA). The  Third-Party  must collect sufficient data to describe irrigated agricultural impacts on \ngroundwater quality and to determine whether existing or newly implemented management \npractices comply with the groundwate r receiving water limitations of the Order.\nThe strategy for evaluating groundwater quality and protection consists of (1) Drinking Water \nSupply Well Monitoring, (2) Groundwater Quality Assessment Report, (3) Management \nPractices Evaluation Program, and (4 ) Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring Program.\n1.  Drinking Water Supply Well Monitoring is designed to identify human health impacts of \nnitrate contamination and notifying well users of any well contaminations of nitrate \nabove the Maximum Contaminant Level ( MCL) for drinking water wells located on \nagricultural property.\n2.  The  Groundwater Quality Assessment Report (GAR)  provides the foundational \ninformation necessary for design of the Management Practices Evaluation Program and \nthe Groundwater Quality Trend Moni toring Program. The GAR also identifies the high \nvulnerability groundwater areas where a Groundwater Quality Management Plan must be \ndeveloped and implemented.\n3.  The overall goal of the  Management Practice Evaluation Program (MPEP)  is to evaluate \nthe effecti veness of management practices in limiting the discharge of waste from \nirrigated lands to groundwater under different conditions (e.g., soil type, depth to \ngroundwater, irrigation practice, crop type, nutrient management practice).\n4.  The overall objectives o f the Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring Program  are to \ndetermine current water quality conditions of groundwater relevant to irrigated agriculture \nand develop long -term groundwater quality information that can be used to evaluate the \nregional effects of  irrigated agricultural practices.\nEach of these elements has its own specific objectives (provided below), and the design of each \nwill differ in accordance with the specific objectives to be reached. While it is anticipated that \nthese programs will provid e sufficient groundwater quality and management practice \neffectiveness data to evaluate whether management practices of irrigated agriculture are  "

Drinking Water Supply Well Monitoring\nAfter Janua ry 1, 2020, Members must initiate sampling of all private drinking water supply wells \nlocated on their property, as described below.  The requirements of this section will not take effect \nif, prior to January 1, 2020, the State Water Board determines that t he legislature has established \na comprehensive statewide program that assures that private drinking water wells will be routinely \nmonitored for nitrate contamination and users of those wells will be notified of the results.\nThe purpose of Drinking  Water Supply Well Monitoring is to identify drinking water supply wells \nthat have nitrate concentrations exceeding the MCL and notify any well users of the potential for \nhuman health impact.\n1. Members must conduct annual drinking water supply well  sampling. Members may submit \none or more annual drinking water supply well sampling results from one or more of the \nfive prior years in lieu of one or more of the first three rounds of annual monitoring \nsamples, provided sampling and testing for nitrates w as completed using EPA approved \nmethods and by an Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program certified laboratory.  If \nthe nitrate concentration is below 8 mg\/L nitrate  +  nitrite as N in three consecutive annual \nsamples, Members may conduct sampling eve ry five years going forward. An alternative \nsampling schedule based on trending data for the well may be required by the Executive \nOfficer at any time.  Sampling may cease if a drinking water well is taken out of service or \nno longer provides drinking water , including where the well is taken out of service because \nsufficient replacement water is being supplied. The Members must keep any records (e.g. \nphotos, bottled water receipts) establishing that the well is not used for drinking water.\n2.  Groundwater sample s must be collected using proper sampling methods, chain -of -\ncustody, and quality assurance\/quality control protocols. Groundwater samples must be \ncollected at or near the well head before the pressure tank and prior to any well head \ntreatment. In cases whe re this is not possible, the water sample must be collected from a \nsampling point as close to the pressure tank as possible, or from a cold -water spigot \nlocated before any filters or water treatment systems.\n3.  Laboratory analyses for groundwater samples must  be conducted by an Environmental \nLaboratory Accreditation Program State certified laboratory according to the U.S. EPA \napproved methods; unless otherwise noted, all monitoring, sample preservation, and \nanalyses must be performed in accordance with the lat est edition of Test Methods for \nEvaluating Solid Waste, SW -846, United States Environmental Protection Agency, and \nanalyzed as specified herein by the above analytical methods and reporting limits \nindicated. Certified laboratories can be found  on  the Water Board's Environmental  Laboratory Accreditation Program (ELAP) website\n. < www.waterboards.ca.gov \\elap > 4.\n All drinking water supply well monitoring data, including any existing data, are to be \nsubmitted electronically to the State Water Boards GeoTracker Database by the testing \nlaboratory. The data submitted shall include the APN where the drinking water supply \nwell is located. "

Objectives.  The main objectives of the GAR are to:\n Provide an assessment of all available, applicable and relevant data and information to \ndetermine the high and low vulnerability areas where discharges fr om irrigated lands may \nresult in groundwater quality degradation;\n Establish priorities for implementation of monitoring and associated studies within high \nvulnerability areas;\n Provide a basis for establishing workplans to assess groundwater quality trends;\n Provide a basis for establishing workplans and priorities to evaluate the effectiveness of \nagricultural management practices to protect groundwater quality; and 8\n \nS everal  Third-Party  groups within the  Central Valley have chosen to participate in a \ncollaborative approach to meet the goals and objectives of this MRP, specifically with respect \nto certain Groundwater Quality Assessment Report and Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring \nRequirements contained  in section IV.B and IV.D. These  Third-Party  groups formed the \nCentral Valley Groundwater Monitoring Collaborative (CVGMC), which has committed to the \ndevelopment and submittal of a Five -Year Assessment Report in lieu of individual  Third-Party  \nGAR updates a nd groundwater quality trend evaluations.

As specified in section IV.F of this MRP, the  Third-Party  is \nrequired to develop a workplan that will describe the methods that will be utilized to meet the \ntrend monitoring requirements.  This MRP allows developing and implementing  a regional \nGroundwater Quality Trend Monitoring workplan that involves participants in other areas or  Third-\nParty  groups, provided the regional workplan meets the objectives and sampling and reporting \nrequirements described herein. The  Third-Party  must sub mit a copy of the agreement between \nthe parties included in the regional Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring Group (Trend \nMonitoring Group). Under this option, the regional workplan may propose a phased approach to \ndevelop and implement the workplan eleme nts specified in section IV.F of this MRP.\n1.  Objectives.  The objectives of Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring are (1) to determine \ncurrent water quality conditions of groundwater relevant to irrigated agriculture, and (2) to \ndevelop long -term groundwate r quality information that can be used to evaluate the regional \neffects (i.e., not site -specific effects) of irrigated agriculture and its practices.\n2.   Implementation.\n To reach the stated objectives for the Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring \nprogram, th e Third -Party  shall develop a groundwater quality monitoring network that will (1) be \nimplemented over both high and low vulnerability areas in the  Third-Party  area; and (2) employ \nshallow wells, but not necessarily wells completed in the uppermost zone of  first encountered \ngroundwater.

Regional \nTrend Monitoring Group participants shall report the results of trend monitoring separately \naccording to the following schedules:\nBy 1 May annually, submitted as part of an Annual  Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring \nReport. 11\n\nBy 30 November 2021 and every fifth year thereafter, included in the Five -Year \nAssessment Report.\nThe annual reports  shall include a map of the sampled wells, tabulation of the analytical data, and \ntime concen tration charts.  Groundwater quality monitoring data are to be submitted electronically \nto the State Water Boards GeoTracker Database and to the Central Valley Water Board.\nFollowing collection of sufficient data (sufficiency to be determined by the method  of analysis \nproposed by the  Third-Party  or Trend Monitoring Group) from each well, the  Third-Party  is to \nevaluate the data for trends.  The methods to be used to evaluate trends shall be proposed by \nthe  Third -Party  or Trend Monitoring Group in the Groundwa ter Quality Trend Monitoring \nWorkplan described in section IV.F below.\nE.  Management Practices Evaluation Workplan\nThe  Third -Party , either solely or in conjunction with a Management Practices Evaluation Group \n(watershed or commodity based), shall prepare a  Management Practices Evaluation Workplan. \nThe workplan shall be submitted to the Executive Officer for review and approval. The workplan \nmust identify a reasonable number of evaluation locations.  It must also encompass the range of \nmanagement practices us ed, the major agricultural commodities, and site conditions under 11\n \nAn Annual Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring Report shall not be due during years in \nwhich a Five -Year Assessment Report is submitted.

The workplan shall be designed to meet the objectives and \nminimum requirements described in section IV.C of this MRP.\n1.\n Workplan approach.  The workplan mu st include a scientifically sound approach to evaluating \nthe effect of management practices on groundwater quality.  The proposed approach may include:\n Groundwater monitoring;\n Tracking applied and removed nitrogen;\n Modeling;\n Vadose zone sampling;  and\/or\n Other scientifically sound and technically justifiable methods for meeting the objectives of \nthe Management Practices Evaluation Program.\nWhere available, shallow groundwater monitoring data should be collected to validate the \nconclusions regarding  the effect of the evaluated practices on groundwater quality.  Any shallow \ngroundwater quality monitoring that is part of the workplan must be of first encountered \ngroundwater.  Monitoring of shallow first encountered groundwater more readily allows \nidentifi cation of changes in groundwater quality from activities on the surface at the earliest \npossible time.\n2.  Groundwater quality monitoring  constituent selection.  Where groundwater quality \nmonitoring is proposed, the Management Practices Evaluation Workplan  must identify:\n The constituents to be assessed and\n The frequency of the data collection (e.g., groundwater quality or vadose zone \nmonitoring; soil sampling) for each constituent.\nThe proposed constituents shall be selected based upon the information collec ted from the GAR \nand must be sufficient to determine if the management practices being evaluated are protective \nof groundwater quality.  At a minimum, the baseline constituents for any groundwater quality \nmonitoring must include those parameters  required under trend monitoring.\n3.  Workplan implementation and analysis.  The proposed Management Practices Evaluation \nWorkplan shall contain sufficient information\/justification for the Executive Officer to evaluate the \nability of the evaluation program t o identify whether existing management practices in \ncombination with site conditions, are protective of groundwater quality.  The workplan must \nexplain how data collected at evaluated farms will be used to assess potential impacts to \ngroundwater at represen ted farms that are not part of the Management Practices Evaluation \nPrograms network.  This information is needed to demonstrate whether data collected will allow \nidentification of management practices that are protective of water quality at Member farms, \ni ncluding represented farms (i.e., farms for which on -site evaluation of practices is not \nconducted).\n4.  Master workplan   prioritization.  If the  Third-Party  chooses to rank or prioritize \nareas\/commodities in its GAR, a single Management Practices Evaluatio n Workplan may be \nprepared which includes a timeline describing the priority and schedule for each of the  "

Upon approval of the Management Practices Evaluation \nWorkplan, the  Third-Party  shall prepare and submit a Monitoring Well Installation and Sampling \nPlan (MWISP), if applicable.  A description of the MWISP and its required elements\/submittals \na re presented as Appendix MRP -2. The MWISP must be approved by the Executive Officer \nprior to the installation of the MWISPs associated monitoring wells.\n6.  Groundwater Protection Formula:  By July 1, 2020, the  Third-Party  shall amend the \nworkplan to propos e a Groundwater Protection Formula (GWP Formula) to the Executive \nOfficer.  The purpose of the GWP Formula is to generate a value (the Groundwater Protection \nValue or GWP Value), expressed as either a nitrogen loading number or a concentration of \nnitrate in  water (e.g. mg\/l) as appropriate, 12\nreflecting the total applied nitrogen, total removed \nnitrogen, recharge conditions, and other relevant and scientifically supported variables that \ninfluence the potential average concentration of nitrate in water expect ed to reach groundwater \nin a given township over a given time period.  The Executive Officer shall approve the proposed \nGWP Formula with any revisions after opportunity for public review and comment.  The  Third -\nParty  shall use the GWP Formula to compute GWP  Values for each township in high \nvulnerability areas as part of its GQMP.  The GWP Values shall be subject to public review and \ncomment and Executive Officer approval.  GWP Values shall be developed and included in the \nGQMP no later than six months from Exec utive Officer approval of the GWP Formula.\n7.  Groundwater Protection Targets by Township:  The first year following the  Third-Party s \ninclusion of GWP Values in the GQMP, the  Third-Party  shall develop Groundwater Protection \nTargets (GWP Targets) for each township for which a GWP Values was computed the prior \nyear.  The purpose of the GWP Targets is to set a desired target that is intended to achieve \ncompliance with the Receiving Water Limi tations for groundwater described in Section III.B of \nthe Order within the time schedule for compliance specified in Section XII of the Order.  The \nGWP Targets shall be informed by the GAR, the MPEP, and the groundwater quality trend \nmonitoring program.  The  GWP Targets shall be reviewed and subject to approval by the \nExecutive Officer after opportunity for public review and comment.  The GWP Targets shall be \nreviewed and revised as necessary every five years.\nF.  Groundwater  Quality Trend Monitoring Workplan\nThe  Third -Party , either solely or in conjunction with a regional Groundwater Quality Trend \nMonitoring Group, shall develop a workplan for conducting trend monitoring within its \nboundaries that meets the objectives and minimum requirements described in secti on IV.D of \nthis MRP.  The workplan shall be submitted to the Executive Officer for review and approval.  If \nthe regional Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring Group option is selected, the workplan must \nbe submitted to the Executive Officer by 31 October 2017 . The regional Groundwater Quality \nTrend Monitoring Workplan may propose a schedule for a phased approach to develop and \nimplement items 1 through 4 below. In addition, the proposed schedule shall include submittal of \na QAPP for the regional Trend Monitori ng Workplan. A single Third-Party  Trend Monitoring  12\n \nThe appropriate metric is to be determined as part of the workplan  development. "

The Trend Monitoring Workpl an must include a discussion of the \nrationale for the number of proposed wells to be monitored and their locations.  The rationale \nneeds to consider: 1) the variety of agricultural commodities produced within the  Third-Party s \nboundaries (particularly those  commodities comprising the most irrigated agricultural acreage), \n2) the conditions discussed\/identified in the GAR related to the vulnerability prioritization within \nthe  Third -Party  area, and 3) the areas identified in the GAR as contributing significant  recharge \nto urban and rural communities where groundwater serves as a significant source of supply.\n2.  Well details.  Details for wells proposed for trend monitoring, including:\n GPS coordinates;\n Physical address of the property on which the well is  situated (if available);\n California State well number (if known);\n Well depth;\n Top and bottom perforation depths;\n A copy of the water well drillers log, if available;\n Depth of standing water (static water level), if available (this may be obtained after \nimp lementing the program); and\n Well seal information (type of material, length of seal).\nComplete well details may not always be available for trend monitoring wells. In these cases, \nwell details must be provided to the maximum extent possible and it must be  reasonable to \nassume that the wells characteristics are such that monitoring results from the well are \nappropriate for use in meeting the objectives of Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring. Wells \nused for trend monitoring that do not have complete well de tails should be flagged so that they \ncan be distinguished within the well network. All wells included in the well network are subject to \nExecutive Officer approval.\n3.  Proposed sampling schedule.  Trend monitoring wells will be sampled, at a minimum, \nannually at the same time of the year for the indicator parameters identified in Table  2 below.\n4.  Workplan implementation and analysis.  Proposed method(s) to be used to evaluate \ntrends in the groundwater quality monitoring data over time. "

As part of this evaluation, the  Third-Party  must analyze all \nreadily available monitoring data that meet program quality assurance requirements to determine \ndeficiencies in monitoring for di scharges from irrigated agricultural lands and whether additional \nsampling locations are needed.  If deficiencies are identified, the  Third-Party  must propose a \nschedule for additional monitoring or source studies.  Upon notification from the Executive Offic er, \nthe  Third -Party  must monitor any parameter in an area that lacks sufficient monitoring data (i.e., a \ndata gap should be filled to assess irrigated agricultures effects on water quality).\nThe  Third -Party  should incorporate pesticide use information, as  needed, to assist in its data \nevaluation.  Wherever possible, the  Third-Party  should utilize tables or graphs that illustrate and \nsummarize the data evaluation.\nReport Component (18)   INMP Summary Report Evaluation\nIn addition to submitting the INMP Summa ry Reports Data, as described in Section V.D above, \nthe  Third -Party  \nshall submit an evaluation comparing individual field data collected from the \nMembers INMP Summary Reports.

A technical justification for initiating the basin plan amendment process including maps of \nthe areas proposed for basin plan amendment. The justification must include an \nassessment of naturally occurring (background ) concentrations of the constituent(s); \nevaluate the potential for irrigated agriculture to further degrade groundwater quality \nbeyond background in the identified areas; and a provide preliminary evaluation as to \nwhether controllable water quality factors  (as defined in the Basin Plan) are reasonably \nlikely to result in attainment of the applicable use(s);\n2.  A use attainability study plan to determine whether the beneficial use(s) proposed for de -\ndesignation may be attained through the application of current  or anticipated \ntechnologies, whether groundwater within the proposed basin plan amendment area is \ncurrently being used for the beneficial use proposed for de -designation, and whether the \ngroundwater proposed for de -designation meets any of the criteria se t forth in the Basin \nPlan that the Board considers in making exceptions to beneficial use designations;\n3.   A description of how the \nThird-Party  will coordinate the basin plan amendment process \nthrough CV -SALTS, if the amendment is based on elevated salt and\/or nitrate \nconcentrations;\n4.  A proposal for reduced reporting requirements for Members in the areas proposed for \nbasin plan amendment. The  Third-Party  may propose that trend monitoring be reduced in \nthose areas.  The  Third -Party  may also propose that the requirement that the \nManagement Practice Evaluation Program evaluate those areas be suspended.

Management Plan Development and Required \nComponents\nThis appendix describes requirements for the development of water quality management plans \nunder Waste Discharge Requirements General Order for Growers within the Tulare Lake Basin \nArea that a re Members of a  Third-Party  Group, Order R5 -2013 -0120 -0 9 (hereafter  Order). \nWhen a management plan has been triggered, the  Third-Party  shall ascertain whether or not \nirrigated agriculture is known to cause or contribute to the  water quality problem (as defined in \nAttachment E). If the potential source(s) of the water quality exceedance(s) is unknown, the \nThird -Party  may propose studies to be conducted to determine the cause, or to eliminate \nirrigated agriculture as a potential source (see Source Identif ication Study Requirements in \nsection I.G. below).\nWhen a Surface Water or Groundwater Quality Management Plan (SQMP\/GQMP) has been \ntriggered, the management plan shall contain the required elements presented and discussed in \nthe following sections. The  Third-Party  may develop one SQMP or GQMP to cover all areas \nwhere plans have been triggered rather than developing separate management plans for each \nmanagement area where plans have been triggered. The  Third-Party  would maintain the \noverarching plan as new  information is collected, potentially triggering additional management \nareas and completion of other management areas.\nIf multiple constituents of concern (COCs) are to be included in a single management plan, a \ndiscussion of the prioritization process and  proposed schedule shall be included in the plan. \nPrioritization schedules must be consistent with requirements described in section XII of the \nOrder, Time Schedule for Compliance.\nIf a number of management plans are triggered, the  Third-Party  shall submit  a SQMP\/GQMP \nprioritization list to the Central Valley Water Board Executive Officer. This list may prioritize the \norder of SQMP\/GQMP development based on, for example, 1) the potential to harm public \nhealth; 2) the beneficial use affected; and\/or 3) the l ikelihood of meeting water quality objectives \nby implementing management practices. Prioritization schedules shall be consistent with \nrequirements described in section XII of this Order, Time Schedule for Compliance. The  Third-\nParty  may continue to utilize  the surface water quality prioritization process described in the \nTule River Sub -Watershed and Main Drain Management Plans, 1\nas approved by the Executive \nOfficer. The Executive Officer may approve or require changes be made to the SQMP\/GQMP \npriority list. The  Third-Party  shall implement the prioritization schedule approved by the \nExecutive Officer.\nA.  Introduction and  Background Section\nThe introduction portion of the management plan shall include a discussion of the COCs that are \nthe subject of the plan and the water quality objective(s) or trigger(s) requiring preparation of the  1\n \nThe Main Drain Management Plan (Kern River Sub -Watershed) and the Tule River Sub -\nWatershed Management  Plan (non -prioritized management plan) were approved by the \nExecutive Officer on 25 October 2012 and 30 October 2012, respectively.
