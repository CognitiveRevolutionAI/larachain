Attachment A to Order R5\n-2013 -0120 -09   Information Sheet   20\nTulare Lake Basin Area\nSeptember 2013   Last Revised April 2021\nThe results of the National Water\n-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA) and GAMA domestic \nwell programs were combined by Bartholomay and others (2007) to produce a map of California \nde picting nitrate concentrations in groundwater within the Central Vall ey Aquifer.\nIn 2009, Ekdahl and others used GeoTracker GAMA to Investigate Nitrate Concentrations in \nCalifornia (Figure 6). The GeoTracker GAMA system is an online database that uses Goog le \nMaps and data bases generated by State and Regional Water Boards ( SWRCB\/RWQCB), \nCalifornia Department of Public Health (CDPH), Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR), \nDepartment of Water Resources (DWR), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and \nLaw rence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The GeoTracker GAMA syste m provides \ndata for over 100,000 sampling locations and analytical results for a variety of constituents \nincluding nitrate.\nA variety of investigators have looked at the San Joaquin Valle y groundwater nitrate \nconcentrations over time (Burow et al, 1998, 20 07, and 2008; Rupert, 2008; and Rosen and \nLapham, 2008). In 1995, NAWQA (Burow, et al 1998) resampled 30 domestic supply wells in \nthe eastern San Joaquin Valley that had previously been s ampled by the U.S. Geological \nSurvey between 1986 and 1987. The media n nitrate concentration for 23 of the 30 wells in \n1986 87 was 2.4 mg\/L, (seven wells had no nitrate sample data) and in 1995 the median \nconcentration for the full 30 wells was 4.6 mg\/L. N itrate exceeded the MCL value in two wells in \n1986 -87 and in five wel ls in 1995.\nIn 2002,  twenty-nine  of the original 30 domestic wells within the regional aquifer were resampled \nfor the third time (Burow, et al, 2008). The median nitrate concentration for the resampled wells \nhad risen from 2.3 mg\/L in 1986 -87 to 5.4 mg\/L i n 2003. Burow and others (2008)  concluded \nthat,  The results of the analysis of regional - and local -scale nitrate concentration data indicate \nthat widespread high concentrations of nitrate in the shallow part of the San Joaquin Aquifer \nsystem are likely to  move to deeper parts of the gro und-water flow system.\nThe trend of nitrate concentrations in the shallow groundwater portion of the Eastern San \nJoaquin Study Area has also been investigated by means of focused studies utilizing monitoring \nwells in three  geographical areas: near Fresno,  near Modesto, and near the Merced River \n(Burow and Green, 2008). Nitrogen fertilizer data were coupled with the results of groundwater \nsampling to show that nitrate concentrations increased over time; corresponded to fertil izer \napplication rates in all th ree focus study areas. Burow and Green (2008) reported that,  Analysis \nusing county -level nitrogen applications and a wide range of chemical data from sampling \nvertical monitoring well transects showed that reconstructed nit rate concentrations are \nconsiste nt with 50% of the applied nitrogen reaching the water table.\nBurow and others (2007) produced a report that expanded upon the data evaluation for the \nfocused study areas of the Eastern San Joaquin Study Area. This study re ported that the nitrate \nconcentr ations in monitoring wells completed in the shallowest part of the aquifer increased in \nconcentration from 8 to 23 mg\/L as NO 3 \nduring the period of time from 1994 -1995 to 2003. \nNitrate concentrations varied considerably with  groundwater depth ranging from  2mg\/L in the \ndeepest monitoring wells to 30 to 40 mg\/L in the shallow wells. This change in concentration \nverses depth is due in part to the age of the groundwater. Based upon chlorinated fluorocarbons \nconcentrations (CFC),  groundwater less than 10 meters  (m) below the water table is  ",
