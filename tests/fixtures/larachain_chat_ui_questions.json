Please answer there questions from the context below and only reference external information if needed.\nContext: Waste Discharge Requirements General Order R5\n-2013 -0120 -09   51\nGrowers within the Tulare Lake Basin Area\nSeptember 2013   Last Revised April 2021\nFigure \n1 Map of the Tulare Lake Basin Area Waste Discharge Requirements General Order R5\n-2013 -0120 -09   22\nGrowers within the Tulare Lake Basin Area\nSeptember 2013   Last Revised April 2021\ntheir waste discharge under other applicable general waste discharge requirements \nor submit a Report of Waste Discharge to the Central Valley Water Board.\nGeneral  Findings\n60 . This Order does not authorize violation of any federal, state, or local law or regulation.\n6 1. This Order does not authorize any act that results in the taking of a threatened or \nendangered species or any act that is now prohibited, or becomes prohi bited in the \nfuture, under either the California Endangered Species Act (Fish and Game Code \nsections 2050 to 2097) or the Federal Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C.A. sections \n1531 to 1544). If a  \"take\" will result from any action authorized under this Orde r, the \nMember shall obtain authorization for an incidental take prior to construction or operation \nof the project. The Member shall be responsible for meeting all requirements of the \napplicable Endangered Species Act.\n6 2. This Order does not supersede the  Central Valley Water Boards Basin Plans and \npolicies, or the State Water Boards plans and policies.\n6 3. As stated in California Water Code section 13263(g), the discharge of waste into waters \nof the state is a privilege, not a right, and regulatory cover age under this Order does not \ncreate a vested right to continue the discharge of waste. Failure to prevent conditions that \ncreate or threaten to create pollution or nuisance will be sufficient reason to modify, \nrevoke, or enforce this Order, as well as pro hibit further discharge.\n6 4. This Order requires Members to provide the  Third-Party  with contact information of the \nperson(s) authorized to provide access to the enrolled property for inspections. This \nrequirement provides a procedure to enable  Board staff  to  contact grower representatives \nso that it may more efficiently monitor compliance with the provisions of this Order.\n6 5. Any instance of noncompliance with this Order constitutes a violation of the California \nWater Code and its regulations. Such noncom pliance is grounds for enforcement action, \nand\/or termination of coverage for waste discharges under this Order, subjecting the \ndischarger to enforcement under the California Water Code for further discharges of \nwaste to surface or groundwater.\n6 6. All dis charges from the irrigated agricultural operation are expected to comply with the \nlawful requirements of municipalities, counties, drainage districts, and other local agencies \nregarding discharges to storm drain systems or to other courses under their juri sdiction.\n6 7. The fact that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the discharge in order to \nmaintain compliance with this Order shall not be a defense for violations of the Order by \nthe Member.\n6 8. This Order is not a National Pollutant Discharge  Elimination System Permit issued \npursuant to the Federal Clean Water Act. Coverage under this Order does not exempt a \nfacility from the Clean Water Act. Any facility required to obtain such a permit must notify \nthe Central Valley Water Board. \n###\n\\n\n\\n"
