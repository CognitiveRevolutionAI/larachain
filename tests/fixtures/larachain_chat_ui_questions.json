Please answer there questions from the context below and only reference external information if needed.\nContext: Waste Discharge Requirements General Order R5\n-2013 -0120 -09   51\nGrowers within the Tulare Lake Basin Area\nSeptember 2013   Last Revised April 2021\nFigure \n1 Map of the Tulare Lake Basin Area Waste Discharge Requirements General Order R5\n-2013 -0120 -09   6\nGrowers within the Tulare Lake Basin Area\nSeptember 2013   Last Revised April 2021\ncontaminant level (MCL) of 10 mg\/L for nitrate plus nitrite as nitrogen (or 45 \nmg\/L of \nnitrate as nitrate) established by the California Department of Public Health (22 CCR  \nsection  64431) that has been set at a level to protect the most at risk groups   infants \nunder six months old and pregnant women. 10\nIn some areas, nitrate \nfrom both agricultural and non -agricultural sources has resulted in \ndegradation and\/or pollution of groundwate r beneath agricultural areas in the Central \nValley. 11\nAvailable data (see Information Sheet and the PEIR) indicate that there are a \nnumber of well s within the Tulare Lake Basin Area that have exceeded the MCL for \nnitrate. Groundwater in the Tulare Lake Basi n Area has been designated for drinking \nwater uses; therefore, the water quality objective of 10 mg\/L for nitrate plus nitrite (as \nnitrogen) appl ies to groundwater in the Tulare Lake Basin Area. Where nitrate \ngroundwater quality data are not available, inf ormation on the hydrogeological \ncharacteristics of the area suggest that significant portions of the Tulare Lake Basin Area \nare vulnerable to nit rate contamination. Sources of nitrate in groundwater include \nleaching of excess fertilizer, confined animal fe eding operations, septic systems, \ndischarge to land of wastewater, food processor waste, unprotected well heads, \nimproperly abandoned wells, and  lack of backflow prevention on wells.\n20 . The Central Valley Water Boards authority to regulate waste discharg es that could \naffect the quality of the waters of the state, which includes both surface water and \ngroundwater, is found in the Porter -Cologne Wa ter Quality Control Act (California Water \nCode Division 7).\n21 . California Water Code section 13263 requires th e Central Valley Water Board to \nprescribe WDRs, or waive WDRs, for proposed, existing, or material changes in \ndischarges of waste that could affe ct water quality. The Board may prescribe waste \ndischarge requirements although no discharge report under Calif ornia Water Code \nsection 13260 has been filed. The WDRs must implement relevant water quality control \nplans and the California Water Code. The Ce ntral Valley Water Board may prescribe \ngeneral waste discharge requirements for a category of discharges if all  the following \ncriteria apply to the discharges in that category:\na) The discharges are produced by the same or similar operations;\nb)  The discharges i nvolve the same or similar types of waste;\nc)  The discharges require the same or similar treatment standards; and\nd)  The discharges are more appropriately regulated under general requirements than \nindividual requirements.\nThe rationale for developing general was te discharge requirements for irrigated \nagricultural lands in the Tulare Lake Basin Area includes: (a) discharg es are produced by \nsimilar operations (irrigated agriculture); (b) waste discharges under this Order involve  10\n \nSee, for example, the  California Department of Public Health Nitrate Fact  Sheet  <\nwww.cdph.ca.gov\/certlic\/drinkingwater\/Documents\/Nitrate\/FactSheet -Nitrate -05 -23 -2012.pdf > 11\n \nPEIR,  Appendix  A \n###"
