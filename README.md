## Reading over LangChain

And just thinking how to make some of those flows work in a Laravel environment

> I am still researching terminology and patterns used by LangChain

## Links

The PHP Vector library

https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-php

## Setup

> Make sure to have .env in place before running `sail up`

Follow the Sail Laravel docs eg `sail up`

Seed the user:

Update your `.env` file:

```dotenv
ADMIN_EMAIL=foo@bar.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=foobaz
```

This just helps since Jetstream requires a team etc to work.



```bash
sail artisan migrate
sail artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
```




## Migration Note

```php 
$table->integer('token_count');
$table->vector('embedding', 1536)->nullable(); 
```


## OH OH 

### Could not set db username and password 
forgot `.env` file then the ups after that did not work

```bash 
./vendor/bin/sail down --rmi all -v
```


## DEMOs

### Spider data from historical site and Embed then search
Get data from a site, make embeddings then make it searchable

> Right not is stops at one spider of the page to just help me get a sense of things
 
> Make sure horizon is running

```bash
sail artisan roach:run CollectionSpider
```
It will dump a demo file `storage/pages`



## TODO
  * Setup Horizon and document
  * Add DocumentContent table for small chunks of data since 
    * they can be too large for prompts
  * Embedding flow with vector
  * UI to easily take in data to embed
  * a ðŸ’©load more



### Demo 

Getting data from https://museums.fivecolleges.edu/info.php?f=option7&type=browse&t=objects&s=abstract

#### Get Data from SOURCE
Using the Project 1 as our over all grouping of the data

```bash 
sail artisan larachain:source 1
```
#### Transform the content

> Use OpenAI to parse the HTML for the data we want

```bash 
sail artisan larachain:transform 1
```

> Use OpenAI to embed the data to make it searchable

```bash 
sail artisan larachain:transform:embed 1
```

> Now we can ask a question keeping it focused around the 
> data for project 1


```bash 
sail artisan larachain:question 1 "What other makers are around the time of O'Keeffe, Georgia" 
```


## Cheats

```bash 
sail artisan larachain:turn_question_into_embedding "What other makers are around the time of O'Keeffe, Georgia"
```
